Daniel Navarro,4.0,22 hours ago,I've lived in NY for a long time. This place is good if you love thin sliced pizza. I do not car for thin sliced pizza. And the flavor was good but I still don't understand the hype about this place.,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100422006357852678261?hl=en-US

Jacqueline,5.0,a day ago,"Went for lunch on a Tuesday at around 12:45pm. As usual, there was a line, but it moved really quickly and I was able to get my pizza 10 minutes later. Don’t let the line deter you from trying Joe’s! The pizza is great as always and the staff are nice. Never disappointed. I tried the caprese pizza and it was great!

There are a lot of people inside and outside so it can get hectic, but turnover for seats is quite quick and I got a seat on the bench outside almost right away.",0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108281841745817069467?hl=en-US

Dre'Ya W,5.0,2 days ago,Big huge New York style pizza slices. Unless you want to order a full pizza make sure you're not too picky because they only have about six different kinds. My friend wanted plain sausage or plain hamburger but they didn't have that. The line was very long but we got through it in about 20 minutes. Not really much seating n,0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114757198007233251028?hl=en

Hazar Panc,4.0,3 days ago,"The place is famous as it was featured on Spiderman. Inside has a cool, vintage vibe. Expect a 5-10 minute wait. The prices are cheap. The pizza is good but nothing groundbreaking. Come for the atmosphere and a decent slice—just don’t expect your mind to be blown!",0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103660781242122461506?hl=en
Kellz g,3.0,3 days ago,"Don’t believe the hype!

They gave me the Raggediest slice they had and it was dry. The Sicilian was “ok”. Sauce not flavorful enough for me. Maybe next week I’ll try them again and ask for a better slice because that kid was trying his damnedest to give away those dried up slices. He got me. Carnegie Pizza is definitely better.

PLUS 98% of customers on that line were tourists So that’s the reason for the high ratings.",0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112416567790621472576?hl=en

Yuri Vantowski,5.0,4 days ago,"Truly is the best slice of NYC pizza I’ve ever had. It is incredible and worth the wait.

Mark Avery,4.0,5 days ago,"This viral place deserves its rep, luckily I visited at 10.30am and walked straight in.  A slice was affordable, hot, fresh and tasty.  Was it the best pizza I’ve eaten, no. Was it really good for the price yes.  Do they know how to bang out slices fast and fresh yes they do.  Overall a great experience however personally I wouldn’t queue for 30+ minutes for a slice",0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108594239589915215252?hl=en
