"I‚Äôm Pete Wells, a food critic for the New York Times for over two decades. I just reviewed the 100 Best Restaurants in NYC. Ask me anything!","Hi I‚Äôm Pete Wells, the New York Times‚Äô restaurant critic. I became a food critic in 2012, and spent six years as the editor of the Food section. I also wrote a column for the Times Magazine called [Cooking With Dexter](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/magazine/20Food-t-000.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hU0.m1-Q.RC5xcex06rYn&smid=re-nytimes), about my life in the kitchen with my young son. Before coming to The Times, I was an editor at magazines including Food & Wine, where I wrote a column called [Always Hungry](https://www.foodandwine.com/author/pete-wells).

As a critic, I‚Äôm interested in finding places that stand out for some reason, and putting them in a context that will help you make sense of the experience they provide, or try to provide. My goal is to find a restaurant people will want to read about; in the longer term, I seek a mix of places that are diverse in location, cuisine, price and sensibility. 

Ask me anything about my restaurant reviewing process, my newly updated list of the [100 Best Restaurants in NYC, which you can read without a subscription here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyc-restaurants.html?unlocked_article_code=1.hU0.ArsZ.ZftDNkwtyWyQ&smid=re-nytimes), and anything to do with food and my job.

Best Restaurants NYC,"So I‚Äôm a New Yorker and have been to most of the restaurants on the Michelin list and I‚Äôve found that I don‚Äôt necessarily agree them on a number of their rankings.

My favorite restaurants atm 

2-3 star
- Jean-Georges 
- Sushi Noz

1 star - no star
- Torrisi (unbelievably good)
- Francie 
- Le Pavillon
- Le Coucou
- Cote (so much fun)
- Golden Swan
- Chick-fil-a

Restaurants I find a little below their hype level 

- Masa
So unnecessarily expensive. Feels like those salt bay restaurants a little bit. Gold leaf as an ingredient. This isn‚Äôt Dubai. Lol.

- Le Bernardin
Kills me to say this, because it‚Äôs such a staple and I‚Äôve been there 5 times over the years, but it‚Äôs become a bit unremarkable. There are a ton of restaurants with 2 stars that I would prefer over Le Bernardin at this point. 

- Saga
Awful. Disgusting bacteria infected natural wine. Tacky decor. The food is sort of confusing conceptually. It‚Äôs like French Moroccan fusion lol. Like crown of duck tagine or something like that. Feels like the sort of place Russians would eat at in Abu Dhabi. Generally unsophisticated atmosphere. I will say though that the space they have is incredible. Unbelievable view of the city. 

- Daniel
It‚Äôs in a state of disrepair. It has what looks like 20 year old carpeting. I feel like they hide behind this image of being old school to avoid having to spend money taking care of the restaurant.

- Per Se
The snobbiness feels a bit performative at this point. That‚Äôs to say that they‚Äôre trying to convince you that it‚Äôs important and exclusive by being so condescending and disinterested.

- Musket Room
Wtf happened to this place? Lol.

Would love to hear other people‚Äôs thoughts. I realize that this is an extremely snobby conversation and would like to have a constructive conversation. If I just shit all over a place that you‚Äôve had a memorable experience at, know that this is simply my opinion and I‚Äôm in no way the authority on the subject.",48,https://www.reddit.com/r/finedining/comments/182ttjf/best_restaurants_nyc/
NYC restaurants,"My husband and I, along with another couple, are going to NYC for 4 nights in early November. We‚Äôre from Canada and are in our early 40s. We will be staying just a bit south of Central Park (close to Times Square/Broadway).

Eating and drinking are our main objectives! We love good food and wine but price is a bit of a factor (for example, happy to pay $80-100 for a bottle of wine, but not $200 or more). We want to avoid tourist traps and overly ‚Äútrendy‚Äù places that price gauge. With all that info, I‚Äôm hoping for recommendations for the following types of restaurants:

1. steakhouse
2. Seafood/sushi
3. Italian
4. Tasting menu
5. Any other musts?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",33,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/16r1tp2/nyc_restaurants/
Must go restaurants in NYC?,"In a previous thread you all noted Michelin star restaurants that are your top recs. Many of which will be really expensive. Thank you.

A few that we enjoyed so far:

1. Joe's Shanghai
2. Jacob's Pickel
3. Jing Fong
4. Made in NY Pizza / Ray's / Joe's

"Upscale, yet not-overly-fancy, chill vibe restaurants / bars in NYC","Hey guys,   
Trying to find a selection of spots in New York that I enjoy hanging out at - primarily looking for a great vibe, beautiful crowd that makes an effort and (potentially) great food, if it's a restaurant.

One place that resonates for sure - Electric Lemon, it's both spacious, upscale, yet not overly fancy and pretentious, and is always a good time to hang out at. 

Another one is Manhatta - same thing, chill vibes, good looking crowd, spacious, great drinks.

Any other suggestions?

Help me prepare a NYC dining bucket list!,"Hi all - I've lived in NYC for about 5 years (East Village) but will be moving out of the city in September. It recently hit me that I only have 6 or so months left in the city to try all of the fantastic dining this city has to offer!

I want to make a concerted effort over the next 6 months to try the tastiest food. I've done an okay job to-date, but heavily concentrated in my neighborhood (EV). What restaurants should I add to my NYC bucket list?

I love all kinds of food, especially Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Thai.

Here are a few of the places I've enjoyed the most in my time here so far:

* 4 Charles (my fav dinner but have only been 2x in 5 years)
* Uluh: Tasty chinese food, fun for groups, upscale ambiance but reasonable prices
* 375 Chicken: My favorite buffalo chicken nuggets in the city, LES, open till 4am
* Levain Bakery: My favorite dessert is chocolate chip cookies (I like theirs with walnuts)
* Lil frankies/franks/supper: Some people clown me for this, but I think it's delish and cozy italian
* Parm: If I want some super greasy italian food and am in Soho with no reservations
* Clinton Street Baking Co: Spanish omelet and best pancakes I've had in nyc
* Soothr: My favorite thai food in EV. Somtum Der is probably second
* Sushi Noz: A total experience. But priced accordingly
* Okiboru House of Tsukemen (ramen): I love ramen and this was the best I had in NYC.
* Crosby Street Hotel: I like going here specifically for brunch. Mostly for the ambiance.

Side note, I also love visiting coffee shops so if anyone has recommendations for those I'm also always open.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bdc2af/help_me_prepare_a_nyc_dining_bucket_list/

TIFU by hiding a bewildered cat on my lap at one of NYC's top restaurants for the duration of an entire meal,"This actually happened today, and I am still reeling over how I get myself into these bad life decisions. Please, if you take anything away from this post, it is to learn from my mistake and not follow in my footsteps. 

- -

I have a really tiny apartment, and my first thought when my S/O brought home a kitten a few months ago, was to leash train her and take her outside once in a while, so that she has a happier life. Fast forward to the present day, and she is a well-trained young cat who likes chilling in a bag/sling, worms her way into road trips, and follows me around outside. Prettymuch as good as cat training is likely to get. 

The thing about cats is, if you dont take them out frequently in their harness, they tend to forget all their training rather quickly, and flop to the floor when you put it on, acting like they'll have no part in any of it.

My friends, S/O, and I had an outing planned for the evening, so when my cat saw me getting ready to go out, and hopped expectantly in my giant over-the-shoulder bag and looked at me with her ""I am ready to go out and oogle pigeons"" eyes, I thought 'oh shit its been almost 2 weeks ... ah I better take her, or I'll have to wait until next weekend', slung the cat bag over my shoulder, and ran out the apartment to catch the train.

Mistake number one.

I'm in a group chat with my friends while riding on the train when I realize (let's call her Hannah .. real name hidden for privacy purposes) Hannah is coming out with us tonight. I didn't know. Hannah has a cat allergy and has specifically told me to 'not bring my cat around her'. I must have not noticed it, when my friends mentioned who's coming, in passing. I mentally smack myself and resolve to listen more carefully in the future. Fuck. At this point, we are almost to the meeting spot and I'm close to being late. I _hate_ being late. And I'd have to take the train all the way back to the apartment, go up, put cat down, head back out, take train again- no, we are like, what? going to a few stores for shopping and then getting bubble tea? no, its fine, I got this, I'll just hide my secret cat for a bit until its time to go home. 

Mistake number two.

At this point, its important to explain that my cat often falls asleep in the bag. I don't know if it's the rolling motion as I walk, or if she just finds it warm and soft with all the freshly laundrerd scarves and gloves in there, but as I'm walking down upper east side where we are to meet up, she's already asleep and you can't even see her, snuggled deep inside. Good, I thought to myself, maybe I can ride this out! The next two hours were a blur of uber rides, shopping, and catching up with each other. Hannah has no clue what's up and didn't sneeze even once. The secret cat was blissfully snoozing away, to the point that I forget she is even there, and go about my merry way. We are now in a totally different part of the city, heading for some cake or some bubble tea, when everyone starts joyfully complaining about how hungry they are, and suggesting that we up the ante for our after-shopping food. Before I know it, they are exclaiming at a restaruant we just passed and joyfully usher us inside. Now this place is PACKED. Chairs and tables so tiny that the wine bottles and plates can barely fit on top are crammed in huge amounts, into a quaint little room, so as to the maximize the restaurant's profits made while paying astronomical nyc rent. This place is obviously very popular, and people are squashed in here, to the point that the door can barely open. Somehow, a table becomes available right as we come in, we sit down and a worker asks to take our coats and bags. As I'm about to hand it over, I look into my purse ... and a furry face looks back up at me. Fuck. I forgot about my secret cat. I panic, say something about being cold, and run over with the coat and bag, to sit at my table.

Mistake number three.

The restaurant is pretty dark and I chose a corner spot on the couch, thinking to just hang the bag on a little hook on the wall next to me, and let her keep sleeping inside. No such luck. The hook area turns out to have a little light above it, to illuminate the area, and it sure as hell illuminates the fuck out of my bag and wakes up the cat. By now, I am seriously panicking, grab the bag and shove it under the table onto my lap. What am I supposed to do??? Tell Hannah and the others that all this time, I had a cat with me and that I was dumb enough to bring her to a restaurant???? No, I got myself into this mess, and I will get myself out. The cat is now fully awake, and wriggling on my lap, trying to see what's up. I start petting the cat, trying to calm her down, and realize my hand doesn't fit in the space between cat and table. I bend closer to the table, trying to look normal, and disentangle the cat from the bag. My hand now fits and there is now literally a cat sitting sitting under the table right on my thighs. The waiter comes around to ask us what we'd like to drink, and cat happily starts trying to poke her head out from beneath, to see what's up. My heart is thudding in my chest, as I gently push the fluffy head back under the table, checking the waiter's face for any sign of having noticed her. I'm pretty sure this is illegal.  I desperately need to distract the cat. I yank a piece of string out of my bag and start to wiggle it in under the table and pet her. She takes this as a sign that I am playing with her and joyfully starts to bite my hand and bite the string. I cringe, but this is working. By the time that our food arrives, she is purring and falling asleep. 

And that is when the waiters crank up HAPPY BIRTHDAY music for some guy in the front, start banging on pots and pans, singing, and ceaselessly dinging one of those little bells, the type that you see in hotel lobbies. Whereas up until now, things were sort of okay, that was no longer the case. I sat there, re-evaluating my whole life and all the bad decisions I've made, as the cat was startled into full on biting my hand. Despite this cacophony from hell, she was surprisingly not afraid, just a bit startled and very awake. All I could think was, PLEASE SEND HELP. They ended up singing happy birthday twice that night, for two different customers. My hand was basically a distracting chewtoy for the cat until she finally fell asleep belly upwards, hugging it. I must have drank almost an entire bottle of wine, trying to ignore the pain. Finally somehow, dinner was done and my friends shuffled out the door. Struggling with my bag and coat and trying to hide cat beneath it all, I slowly followed. 

You know how when you're drinking and sitting down, you don't really feel it? And then you stand up and it hits you that you're drunk? 

I bravely stand up, so happy to be finally out of this nightmare of my own doing, knock over two chairs and the drop the coat straight to the floor. I am in the middle of the restaurant, standing straight as a bolt, clearly hugging a cat. The man holding the door (all my friends are outside already) does not look happy. He also looks like he is not a waiter. As I realize that he is probably the owner of the restaurant, I pick up the chairs, grab my coat, and bolt out the door in three seconds flat. Animals aren't allowed in food establisents and I know what I did was probably illegal. I am so scared and I fucking _run_ for it. I am now never welcome back at one of my favorite restaurants. Today, I've inadvertantly crossed the line to becoming a crazy cat lady. Needless to say, I won't be doing this again. Notice the symptoms early. Don't end up like me. 

p.s. if moderators allow (not 100% sure with intricate rules) proof of cat in said situation will be given. No names of location visible, of course. ^edit ^0: ^there ^are ^6 ^links ^hidden ^in ^the ^comments

tl;dr: I am an idiot who forgot her cat was sleeping in her purse, and thought it would be OK to just 'ride it out' and keep hiding her at a crowded restaurant, and now can never go back there again.

edit 1: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger! I used to joke that if I ever got reddit 'famous' (ha), it could only ever be for something really ridiculous/dumb, that I did. Lo and behold! I am happy that my blunder at least made you (and everyone else here) smile.

I Need To Air Out a Popular NYC Restaurant Owner Who has Gotten Away with Things for Too Long,"So, this is new territory for me but this week I reached a breaking point with this man and his sh\*\*ty behavior. Maybe this is the way to handle it, maybe it isn't- I can't really say one way or another but here I am.

Ed's Lobster Bar on Lafayette St. has been around for like 15 years or so, and at its peak was incredibly popular and successful. It was definitely a place to go if you were a bitch with taste back in the day. It was during its hay-day that I worked there, and all my old coworkers who ran the place back in the day are still close- we all put in somewhere around 6-12 years working for this man (Ed).

So let's just say we've collectively seen a lot of sh\*t.

I honestly don't know where to begin- but basically everyone who has worked for him and everyone in the NYC restaurant world just kind of knows this guy's an a\*\*hole. Constant verbal abuse including yelling at workers ""are you F\*\*king R\*t4rded??!"", sexually harassing staff and hitting on women customers (sometimes successfully, AND in front of us, AND then we would have to serve his wife when she came in and pretend we didn't know), showing p0\*n to kitchen workers while they are on the clock and can't escape, telling a bartender to ""s\*ck his d\*\*k"" in front of the whole restaurant, making r4cist comments to one of the women bartenders about her black SO, then telling her she could do better because he was constantly trying to hook up with this woman, not fixing the hood in the kitchen during a sweltering NYC summer and people were close to heat stroke because the kitchen was 120 degrees- in this instance he also refused to close down and send them home, which caused a long time staffer to finally quit.... The list goes on and on and honestly I know there are first hand stories that other people besides myself have that would go into way more explicit details...

As I have been compiling this list one of my co workers reminded me that he used to call the blueberry gimlet shots ""Ed's Date Rape Shots"" ü§Æ. Also there are some recent things coming out of the woodwork about his treatment of his many au pairs, which I won't say more about until I get more info but it doesn't sound good.

Anyway, fast forward to today. Most of us (including me) eventually reached some form of breaking point and left. A few of the OGs stayed on and helped weather through the pandemic, as well as the relocation of the restaurant to a different building, both of which caused this place a huge decline in business and as recent as last month, the restaurant had become a shell of it's former self. The only staff that remained from the old days are 4 men who work in the kitchen- all 4 of them incredible workers, all 4 of them fiercely loyal.

So come to find out he hasn't been paying these guys for the last couple of months. Somewhere around 9-10 paychecks he owes them, and apparently he was paying them a reduced rate since November! These guys still showed up for him every day, because they worked for this man for 15 years, and he kept telling them he was doing everything he could to fix things. So imagine our surprise when we find out that last Monday they showed up to a completely empty restaurant, and this coward won't pick up the phone.

He's so f\*\*ing skeezy this is how it went down: He told them that he was going to close for a couple days to get the finances in order. The kitchen manager came in the next day to freeze all the food (because he's an amazing person who cares about the place) to find the place completely deserted. The homeless man who sleeps across the street told him that Ed had showed up the night before at 3am and payed this man to help load everything into Ed's truck. Truly despicable

As this starts to come out, people start calling out Ed on Instagram, as well as trying to help these guys get new jobs (something Ed could have done instead of lying to them and robbing them for months). The main thing people are calling him out about is just getting these guys paid- they can't afford to not have income for this long! But he's choosing to remain completely silent like the coward he is. So now we're all getting increasingly pissed off and we're ready to fully air out his dirty laundry.

And as of today, my friend sent me a story Ed posted on his own insta - PROMOTING HIS DJ SIDE HUSTLE. None of us saw it because he has apparently blocked everyone who could be associated with the restaurant but that dumb\*ss is still making public posts promoting himself.

So yeah, this post is where I'm starting. And if anyone wants to go on his IG and put him on blast his account is chefedm, the restaurant account is edslobsterbar, and he has listings on google maps and yelp

TLDR: Ed MacFarland of Ed's Lobster Bar robbed his kitchen workers of months of income after 15 years of loyal service, and then shut down the restaurant in the middle of the night without telling anyone. Now he's actively promoting his DJ-ing side hustle while the kitchen guys scramble to find new jobs",793,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbitcheswithtaste/comments/1c1vcub/i_need_to_air_out_a_popular_nyc_restaurant_owner/

I'm a 27F from Johannesburg, South Africa. My fianc√©, Will (27M), is American. We met in 2018 during my MSc (Master of Science) in England. We dated briefly but lost touch after. In 2021, he reconnected with me via Instagram, and our relationship blossomed. He‚Äôs visited South Africa a few times, and I‚Äôve visited him in New York once. In May 2024, he proposed to me during a visit to Johannesburg, and I happily accepted.

Recently, I got time off work and visited him in New York again. We also planned a trip to Atlanta to meet his family, whom I hadn‚Äôt met before. I was excited but nervous. At first, everything seemed fine‚Äîhis family welcomed me with a big dinner. However, his mother and aunt made some stereotypical and uneducated comments about South Africa, which I found amusing but also slightly irritating. They kept asking why I sounded British and even compared me to Hermione from Harry Potter. Then, his mother said, ""I‚Äôm honestly wondering how you‚Äôre South African if you‚Äôre not black. I didn‚Äôt even know there were white people in South Africa!""

As a naturally witty and sarcastic person, I responded without thinking, saying something like, ‚ÄúYeah, we just magically appeared there one day, like poof!‚Äù In hindsight, I can see how this might have been the wrong approach, but it was my immediate reaction. His mother and aunt were clearly offended, and the evening became awkward.

Will noticed the tension and got upset. When he drove me back to my hotel, he started ranting about how disrespectful I was to his mother and aunt. He talked about how important respect is in his family and didn‚Äôt let me explain. I apologised, still confused because I didn‚Äôt think much of my comment at the time‚Äîit was meant to be lighthearted. However, Will raised his voice, expressing his disappointment and saying we‚Äôd talk about it later. Since then, he hasn‚Äôt responded to my messages or come back to the hotel to speak to me.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering if I was really out of line. I didn‚Äôt mean to be disrespectful, but I didn‚Äôt expect them to be so sensitive. So, AITA?

***Relevant Comments:***

Commenter: NTA I'm most bothered by your bf tbh. His family says all this rude crap to you, and to him that's all fine but the big problem is you clapping back? Seriously? He raises his voice and shuts down your attempts to tell your side, ""we'll talk about this later."" Does he think he has authority over you? Is that the standard in your relationship?

>**OOP:** If it weren‚Äôt for the context, I might‚Äôve found his reaction humorous because he‚Äôs never really been the threatening type, and I can‚Äôt imagine him talking to me like that in any other situation. It felt very forced.

Commenter: INFO: Are your fianc√© and his family Black? If so, I can see imperialism making your quip not funny to a Black family

>**OOP:** No, they're a White American family. I'm assuming their ancestry is Anglo, but as far as I'm aware neither he nor anyone in his family has done an ancestry test.

Commenter: I‚Äôm confused that they had never seen your picture. Were they surprised you were white? Or this was the first time they were able to voice it? Either way, NTA. Sounds like you matched their energy.

>**OOP:** They have seen me, I think they assumed I was British because we originally met while he and I were studying in England. I don't really understand this myself and currently don't have the opportunity to ask.

Commenter: INFO: You're long distance, you've gone all that way specifically to visit him and he isn't staying at the hotel with you? Unless it's one of those no sharing a room before marriage things what's that all about? Because if there's not some specific reason I'd say there's other problems here

>**OOP:** When we were planning this trip, he had suggested to me that we stay with his family. I rejected this idea as I did not want to impose on his family, and am also generally uncomfortable of the idea with staying with others, hence why I booked my own hotel, which I am glad I did in hindsight. I had expected him to stay with me - but I guess he's staying with his family now.

Commenter: I‚Äôd give him until tomorrow before booking a flight back. Meanwhile make plans for yourself tomorrow am to enjoy NY.

>**OOP:** (after midnight) Depending on how tomorrow (or, well, today now) goes, I'll probably return to NY. My departing flight is from NY anyways, and I have friends there, and want to make this a nice holiday and enjoy the rest of the week!

Commenter: Side note, I'm guessing his mom and aunt have never heard of Elon Musk or apartheid?

>**OOP:** I have no idea. I guess not. I'm assuming they think Musk is British, just like they thought I was.

*OOP clarifies:*

>I just want to clarify that while we are in a long-distance relationship, we originally met because we studied at the same university, so it's not a case of online dating or not knowing each other well enough. As for not meeting his family, it's because the only times we've been around each other in person were during university in England, when he visited me in Johannesburg, or when I visited him in New York. His family didn't leave Atlanta during any of these periods. He has met my family during previous visits, and it went well.

Commenter: Their comments were also very innocuous, why did you take offence?

>**OOP:** While their comments may not have necessarily been intended to be rude, it becomes very exasperating listening to this for more an hour. I didn't include it in the original post because of the limit but they were asking me how often I see or interact with wild animals, how do I do my work if there's issues with power outages and electricity, supposed poverty and crime in SA (don't you feel much safer in America?), and continuously asking me why I sounded British and not ""African."" They said more things which I can't even remember or really articulate at this point. After all of this, all I responded with was a light quip which I don't think should have warranted the reaction it did.

***OOP is voted NTA***

**Update** [Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f4nptg/update_aita_for_being_sarcastic_to_my_fianc%C3%A9s/)**: August 30, 2024 (Next Day)**

Hi everyone, it's been a long day, and I just wanted to update you all since many of you asked what happened.

After a restless night, Will called me around 9 this morning, saying he was coming to the hotel to talk. I was still angry, last night he gave me the silent treatment after I messaged him multiple times, and now he wants to talk on his terms? But I figured we needed to sort this out.

When he arrived, I didn‚Äôt let him speak first. I told him how hurt I was by his actions, especially how he shut me out instead of addressing the situation. He apologised, admitting he felt insecure about his family's ignorance and behaviour, and took it out on me. He promised to make it up to me. (Though I completely forgot to ask him why he didn‚Äôt prepare them beforehand or at least tell them more about me being South African.)

He also mentioned that one thing about me that he struggles with is that I can be a bit too ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù in the sense that I ""don‚Äôt back down, admit when I‚Äôm wrong, or know when to stay silent"", and this apparently caused problems for him last night, me not holding my tongue with that quip was embarrassing to him as a display to his family. This links back to something he‚Äôs mentioned before about how I never get too emotional or cry. He confessed that last night when he dropped me off, he was actually on the verge of tears, so he left like that. He admitted he shouldn‚Äôt have, and that it was wrong of him to leave me like that especially after what had just occurred.

But then he insisted I needed to apologise to his mother and aunt. I flat-out said no. But he kept pestering me, saying he didn‚Äôt want his fianc√©e's first meeting with his family to end on a bad note, ""Think of how this looks for me."" I eventually, albeit reluctantly, agreed. So, I got ready, and we headed over to his parents‚Äô place. The car ride was awkward; he kept trying to make small talk about what happened after he dropped me off.

We arrived at the house, and honestly, the feeling of dread just hit me again. His aunt was there again, and from what I gathered, she came back specifically to receive my apology. Will‚Äôs sister, who was there last night, was not there, but the aunt came back just for this, which I found a bit much, this was clearly very important to her to hear me apologise. His dad greeted me, but his mum and aunt were clearly waiting to have their say. They talked about how hurt they were by my comment, and I apologised, saying I didn‚Äôt mean to offend them, I just didn‚Äôt know how to respond to what they said last night and made a joke that wasn‚Äôt meant to be disrespectful.

But they couldn‚Äôt leave it at that. They started lecturing me about how I was poorly raised in South Africa for speaking to elders like that, calling me ill-mannered. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôd had enough. I turned away from them, and they freaked out. I walked away as they continued ranting. Will tried to grab my arm and tell me I wasn‚Äôt acting properly, but I pulled away, and he let go.

I walked out of their home, and they all followed me, his mum and aunt loudly commenting, and Will trying to talk to me. His father just stood there on the veranda, watching the whole scene unfold. It was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life, I felt like their neighbours would come out to see what all the fuss was about. I asked Will to drive me back to the hotel, but he refused and kept lecturing me, so I called an Uber. Waiting for it was incredibly awkward, with all of them continuing to go on.

I eventually got back to the hotel, immediately canceled my flight back to NY with him, and booked a later flight for myself. I checked out of the hotel and waited at the airport until my flight.

Now, I‚Äôm with my friend in NY. Will has been messaging me nonstop since, so I blocked him on everything. He‚Äôll probably continue to annoy me on all my social media and love bomb me when I get back to Johannesburg, but I‚Äôll deal with it then.

Oh, and I left my thermos, which is sentimental to me because it has a lot of stickers that I've collected over the years, at his flat, which he's not likely going to return to me, but oh well.

On a brighter note, I‚Äôm planning to enjoy the rest of my holiday with my friend in New York! Thanks to everyone for your comments and messages, and a special thanks to the user who recommended restaurants in NYC. My friend also read my post and agreed with those of you who were skeptical about long-distance relationships, she‚Äôd wanted to tell me her concerns for a long time.

Thanks again, everyone. I really appreciate the support, advice, and sweet messages.

TLDR: This engagement is done.

***Relevant Comment:***

Commenter: You chose well. His lack of spine is obvious, and he has no idea how much resilience and fight resides in a South African.

Restaurants in Orlando are just as expensive as NYC.,"I live in the NYC metro now, after 10 years living in Orlando.  While the rents in NY are obviously in another stratosphere, I‚Äôve noticed that the cost of eating out is about the same, if not more in Orlando.

Sushi Eats Station on Colonial is great, but it‚Äôs like $16 for a sushi bowl that is 75% sticky rice.  Lazy Moon is pretty good, but it cost me and my friend $17 for 2 slices of pizza.  That bowl would‚Äôve like $11 in NY, and 2 slices of huge pizza maybe $13 at the most.   All of those Asian restaurants on 50 are more expensive than most equivalent nyc Asian restaurants.

Back in the day in Orlando, I could always count on the Latin joints to give me a very generous portion of whatever I ordered for like $10.  I visited one of my favorite places last time I was in Florida, and‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not the same.  The tripletta got smaller and more expensive than from just 2 years ago.

The only 2 places in Orlando I can think of that give you bang for your buck is Statsio‚Äôs and Mediterranean Deli.  Those 2 places are more like what you‚Äôd find in NY, price and portion-wise.

Don‚Äôt @ me.  I love Orlando.  I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs kind of odd that the restaurants down there are more expensive than New York.

AITA for not buying my fianc√©e‚Äôs brother an expensive wedding gift and giving second thoughts about our relationship?,"**I am NOT OOP, OOP is** u/FAZJLU

**Originally posted to r/AITAH**

**AITA for not buying my fianc√©e‚Äôs brother an expensive wedding gift and giving second thoughts about our relationship?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!financial exploitation, entitlement!<

-------------------------------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/J8ZFMUGK5e): **September 16, 2024**

I (32M) have a successful business in NYC, and I‚Äôm engaged to my fianc√©e (26F). We‚Äôve been together for a few years, and we‚Äôre planning to get married in June 2025. I‚Äôm doing pretty well financially, and I recently bought a house where she‚Äôll move in after the wedding.

I‚Äôm really close with my younger brother (30M), and we‚Äôve been best friends for as long as I can remember. He got married in April, and as a wedding gift, I surprised him with a Rolex he‚Äôd been eyeing for a while. He didn‚Äôt expect it and was over the moon about it, which made me feel great because I love him to death.

Now here‚Äôs where things get sticky. My fianc√©e‚Äôs older brother got married two weeks ago, and leading up to his wedding, she kept making comments about how much her brother loves Rolexes. She‚Äôd mention it here and there, but I didn‚Äôt really pay much attention. For her brother‚Äôs wedding, I decided to gift him a $2,000 prepaid credit card as a honeymoon gift. I thought it was a generous gesture, and he seemed grateful.

But after the wedding, my fianc√©e started acting strange. Today, she finally told me she was disappointed in me. Apparently, she‚Äôd convinced herself that I was going to get her brother a Rolex, just like I did for mine. She even hinted to her brother and some of her friends that I was going to buy him a ‚Äúfancy‚Äù gift, like a Rolex. Now she‚Äôs saying that I was cheap because I ‚Äúonly‚Äù gave her brother a $2,000 gift, and how it doesn‚Äôt compare to the $20,000 I spent on my brother‚Äôs watch.

I‚Äôm honestly shocked and upset. Why would she think I‚Äôd spend that kind of money on her brother just because I did it for mine? I love her brother, but there‚Äôs no comparison between him and my own brother, who‚Äôs my best friend. I feel like she‚Äôs completely overlooking the fact that I gave her brother a gift that most people would consider very generous.

Now I‚Äôm starting to have serious second thoughts about this relationship. I never imagined she‚Äôd put this kind of pressure on me or act like I owe her family the same kind of money I spend on my own. I‚Äôm thinking of confronting her, but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm missing something here.

AITA for not buying her brother a Rolex and being upset about her reaction?

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. If that is the kind of expectation she wants out of you, you better reevaluate your relationship with her.

**Commenter 2:** NTA

She's a gold digger.  If your fiancee wanted her brother to have a Rolex, she should have bought it for him.  

If this relationship continues, you need a prenup, preferably one that protects your premarital assets, future income, retirement accounts, and limits any post-divorce support.  Her reaction when you tell your fiancee that you want a prenup and to have separate finances will tell you everything you need to know.

**Commenter 3:** Here‚Äôs what your fiance is really telling you. When you‚Äôre married, you‚Äôre going to be expected to use your wealth at her discretion, specifically with regard to her family. If you‚Äôre not ok with that, you need to have that conversation now. NTA

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/VOr6xgCzdZ): **September 20, 2024**

It‚Äôs been a few days since my original post, and I‚Äôve gone through many of your comments. Before I dive into the update, I want to address some common questions.

First, a lot of you criticized me for giving my brother a Rolex as a wedding gift, saying a wedding gift should be for the couple. To clarify, I did give my SIL a separate gift‚Äîa gold jewelry set from her favorite brand.

Second, many of you said some harsh things about my fianc√©e, questioning whether she even has a job. She‚Äôs currently completing her PhD, with offers from both Meta and Google. I have no doubt she'll be earning a great salary once she finishes.

As for our age difference, she‚Äôs 26 and I just turned 32, so it‚Äôs only a 5-year gap. It‚Äôs disappointing that some of you assumed she was with me just for money. Also, for those who asked, she gave my brother a gift worth around $1,000.

Now, for the actual update. I asked her to meet me for dinner, and after we went to a nice restaurant, we headed back to my place. I brought up the tension that‚Äôs been building in our relationship over the last few weeks, and she immediately blamed me‚Äîclaiming I embarrassed and insulted her brother with the gift I gave him.

At that point, I nearly lost it. I reminded her of everything I‚Äôve done for her over the years, including letting her live rent-free in my old apartment (which I could easily rent out for $3,500+ per month). I was too drained to argue any further, so I brought up the topic of a prenup. I told her it was in both of our best interests to sign one before getting married.

Her reaction was intense. She went wide-eyed, started yelling, and accused me of believing she was only with me for my money. She was furious that I would even consider divorce. After arguing for over an hour, I finally said I needed more time to think about our relationship. She asked if I was breaking up with her, and I said ‚Äúyes.‚Äù

She went quiet for a few minutes before asking what I wanted her to do with the engagement ring. I told her she could keep it. Then she asked about the apartment. I told her she could stay until the end of October, but after that, she‚Äôd need to find a new place. She seemed shocked by my answer, though I‚Äôm not sure what she was expecting.

In short, we‚Äôve ended our relationship. She tried calling me yesterday, but I was in a meeting and didn‚Äôt pick up. She later texted asking if we could meet on Saturday, and while I agreed, I‚Äôve already made up my mind‚ÄîI‚Äôm not going back to her.

Her dad reached out, and while we‚Äôve always gotten along, he was understanding and wished me the best. On the other hand, my mom isn‚Äôt happy with me, mostly because she got close to her, and I didn‚Äôt share the real reason behind the breakup.

It sucks, especially after all the time and energy I invested in the relationship, but honestly, I‚Äôm glad it happened now rather than a few years down the line. Going forward, I‚Äôm not rushing into another serious relationship unless I find the right person. Time to enjoy being single.

**Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I think u made the right decision. She is going to he earning a great salary soon why wouldn't she want a prenup? A prenup is 2 sided so she could ask for whatever she wanted too. So yes good decision.

**Commenter 2:** Buying your brother that Rolex was the best money you've ever spent. Because what you learned about you fiancee was priceless.

**Commenter 3:** I'm not sure what kind of income bracket she lives in to think a $2k wedding gift is somehow insulting or embarrassing. I grew up in a tax bracket where $200 was on the very generous side.

But if she's going to react like that, you're better off.

#----NEW UPDATE----

**DISCLAIMER: OOP HAS UPDATED AFTER THE BoRU WAS POSTED**

**SO PER RULES UPDATE IS INCLUDED**

[Final Update](https://new.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fr1258/final_update_aita_for_not_buying_my_fianc%C3%A9es/): **September 27, 2024**

There are two posts that lead up to this one, so I suggest you read those first for context.

A lot of you asked me for another update, and honestly, I never thought I'd be giving one, but here we are.

Before we get to the update, I wanted to answer some of the questions I saw in the comments. Many of you were curious about my and my ex-fianc√©e's backgrounds. I'm of South Asian (Pakistani) descent, and she's half Swiss and half German.

Some of you even questioned if she lied to me about doing a PhD. I can assure you that she is actually pursuing a PhD and should be finishing in a couple of semesters. Also, when we first started dating, she didn't know much about my financial situation, so I don‚Äôt think she started dating me because of my money. Of course, it probably influenced things once she found out, but I don't think it was her initial motivation.

Now, for the update. Like I mentioned in my previous post, she wanted to meet in person, and I agreed. However, I later changed my mind and suggested that we talk over the phone instead. We ended up having a detailed conversation the other day. No, she didn‚Äôt say she was pregnant. Instead, she informed me that she would be moving out of my apartment by October 15th. She also offered to return the engagement ring, but I told her to keep it.

During our conversation, she mentioned that she misses me and regrets how she handled things. She admitted that she would have approached the situation with a different, more mature attitude if I had brought up the prenup now. In short, she was very apologetic. I told her that whatever happened, happened for the best, and I wished her well. She wished me the best too, and we said our goodbyes. Overall, it was a mature conversation, and I feel like she understands that she was in the wrong. She asked if we could stay friends, and I said sure, but honestly, I don‚Äôt think we'll have much contact moving forward‚Äîespecially after she moves out.

Many of you also suggested that I tell my mom the real reason for ending the engagement. My mom has been out of the country, so I haven't had much chance to talk to her, but today I finally had an opportunity to explain everything in detail. My mom was shocked, to say the least. She told me that my ex has been in contact with her almost every day since the breakup, saying how she was looking forward to becoming her daughter-in-law, how she had already started planning the wedding, and how much she was going to miss her. My fianc√©e was always close to my mom and often told me how much she loved her, so I'm not sure of the real motivation behind these calls‚Äîwhether it's genuine or if there's a hidden agenda. Regardless, my mom now understands why I made the decision I did, and she fully supports me.

So that's the final update. Overall, I‚Äôm confident I made the right decision.

I went to Craig and Austen‚Äôs NYC restaurant last night‚Ä¶,"Okay here‚Äôs my take:

It was opening night. They were both there, sitting in a banquette with Kyle. Paige and Ciara were at the bar. The food and service were fantastic. The chef/owner Jordan came by our table to ask how everything was and thank us for coming. He pointed out his partner Phil, and made absolutely no mention of C & A even though they were sitting 3 feet from us. 

I didn't see either of them speak to any patrons- they just huddled up guzzling red wine and discussing where to go next. They left around 11pm. I'm guessing their investment is very small, and very, very silent.

Also worth noting- Paige left about an hour before the boys, and we never once saw Craig and Paige interact other than when she came by his table to say she was heading out.

Austen is taller than I expected, Kyle was shorter. Paige and Ciara both looked gorgeous.

I'll post some pics of the food. The butter candle was SO good. We also had the ""PBJ,"" Uni truffle pasta, heirloom salad, and waygu steak.

Overall the place was on point and we will definitely return, but it's painfully obvious this is not ""their restaurant.‚Äù",547,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/126yahp

I'm a hostess at a NYC restaurant getting yelled at and attacked by tourists about masks and vaccines - it's a citywide mandate!,"I've been helping out at a family friend's restaurant. I have a 9-5 job, and then I get to the restaurant around 6, when restaurant foot traffic starts picking up. Every day, there is at least 1 customer who throws a tantrum about how they can't sit inside if they're not vaccinated. I can almost predict the troublemakers at this point. They are tourists 9 out of 10 times, and they have started leaving negative Yelp reviews blaming the owner. It is a NYC mandate, for fuck's sake! Citywide!

By the way, we have a heated outdoor space where they're free to sit, and plenty of people sit there, but they feel entitled to sit indoors. They know NYC is stricter about masks and vaccines. So they refuse to get vaccinated and hate our policies, yet they come all the way here so they can lose their shit about not being able to go to most attractions or restaurants. Makes no sense to me. 

I'm so fed up at this point. I'm a 5'2"" woman and I've had tourists spit on me, throw things, damage property, make physical threats, yell at the top of their lungs like a child, make racist comments, and so much other nonsense. Most of the staff are college students and young people just trying to pay off student loans. Last night, we had a guy throw a chair at waiter Dave. Dave asked him to put on a mask while in line for the restroom, and this hillbilly's natural reaction was to throw a chair, which hit Dave in the ribs and we ended up calling the police on this guy because he wouldn't calm down. Of course, the police showed up an hour after that group left.

Anyways, please be nice to restaurant staff. We go through a lot. 

P.S. I'm not trying to start a vaccine debate. I'm vaccinated and I wish everyone would get vaccinated, but I also really do not care what you do with yourself. By 6pm, I'm so tired after work that I mainly roll my eyes at these people.

AITA for not giving my girlfriend (25f) my dinner after I had already bought her dinner?,"My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise ""surprise bags"" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.

I ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.

When I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.

My girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.

She got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.) She says she the grill is probably off there and all she wants is a hot meal. I tell her she has soup.

Anyway, she thinks I'm the asshole. But in my defense:

(1) I offered to buy her barbecue to begin with, which she declined.

(2) she picked out her own food and I grabbed it for her on my way home

(3) when she wasn't satisfied, I suggested two solutions (either ordering something from an app or going to a bodega)

Boomers ruin shit and tell you that you should be grateful,"Does anyone else have a boomer like this?

This happened almost two years ago but it still enrages me whenever I think about it. Before the pandemic started, I bought tickets to go see Rage Against The Machine at Madison Square Garden in New York City. I live in Los Angeles, so I planned a whole week-long trip to NYC around this concert. Unfortunately, the concert was postponed twice due to COVID.

When the concert's rescheduled date was finally solid, I decided to book my flight. I was talking about the trip on the phone with my Boomer and she insisted on booking my flight for me as a gift. I was meeting friends in NYC and we spent a full evening on the phone booking restaurants, museum tickets, show tickets, and other things, and I found the perfect flight that would get me there in time for everything. They only had two tickets left.

I called my mom and told her I wanted this particular flight. She said ok and to send her the flight information and she would book it. I sent a link to the flight, screenshots, etc, and made it super easy for her to book. I told her it was absolutely imperative that I get on this particular flight as my friends and I had things planned. She insisted that she would book it.

I live in a different time zone than her, and when I woke up the next morning, I didn't see a flight confirmation email in my inbox, so I called her. She answered sounding very annoyed that she was in her doctors waiting room for a routine checkup and whisper-yelled at me WHAT DO YOU WANT. I decided to just call her back.

Come 5pm and I still didn't have a flight confirmation email, so I called her again and she again picked up all pissed off, yelling at me that she was in Costco and why the hell do I keep calling her. I told her that she promised to book a flight for me and that there were only two seats left almost 24 full hours ago and that it was absolutely essential that I get on this flight. She told me she forgot and will do it later. I got mad and was like WTF, there were only two seats left last night and she started screaming into the phone that I'm getting a free flight so I can just shut the fuck up and she'll book the flight whenever she fucking feels like it and how I need to be grateful that she's offered to do me this favor, etc, and hung up on me.

She left me no choice but to book the flight myself, and I got the last seat. She called me when she got home from Costco and kept yelling about how I was ungrateful and I told her that she had done nothing to be grateful for except almost ruining my trip, why would I be grateful for that???

It still pisses me off as much as the day it happened every time I think about it.

ETA: She wanted to use points, not money to pay for the flight. Also, to all the boomers in the comments getting downvoted, complaining that I need my mommy to book my flight, I‚Äôm 40F and she offered to book the flight, I didn‚Äôt ask. I didn‚Äôt beg, you all have reading comprehension issues. If she said she was going to book the flight for me, why would I not take her at her word and believe her?

And here is the list, as it was written to me by the chef.  Yes I am aware that Balthazar is not a secret but it was on the list.  



Balthazar - any time of day or night

Bottega del Vino for a great cappuccino

Babbo - have dinner at the bar

Pastis for lunch

Morandi for the fried artichokes

Cafe Boulud - don't know the latest chef but one of our favorites

Nougatine - more 'casual' side of Jean-Georges

Empanada place - can't remember name but across street from Downtown-buy a couple to snack on later

Blue Ribbon - late night dinner where chefs like to go after work

Red Cat

Lupa - order everything that sounds good to you

Pegu Club - interesting cocktails...no vodka

None would be where they are now, if it weren't for the Union. As a former Union member & leader, this breaks my heart.

""You did it!

Several weeks ago, many of our drivers bonded together and signed a petition stating they no longer wanted to be represented by IBEW Local 1430. Then, on April 11, one brave driver filed a petition with the NLRB asking for an election. The Company then worked with the NLRB to protect our drivers' rights to vote in a secret ballot election. Before the election, our drivers spent a lot of time getting the facts to understand their rights before making this important decision. 

Last Friday, May 3, the NLRB held a secret-ballot election in our test kitchen. 105 drivers voted and, by a vote of 72 to 33, our drivers voted against union representation. Our drivers decided to put their trust in the Company and our leaders instead of continuing to pay dues to Local 1430 as their representative. Our drivers are now union-free - and you no longer have to pay union dues. 

While we are proud of our drivers for learning the facts and making an informed decision that continuing to have Local 1430 represent them is not in their best interests. It is now time to put your full trust in our Company and leadership team - we will not let you down. 

In the coming weeks and months, managers and leaders will continue working closely with you and working hard to create and execute on a plan of action to earn your trust and address your concerns. 

For those 72 drivers who voted NO, thank you for your vote of confidence in our company and leadership team. That says a lot about our relationships. To those 33 drivers who voted to remain involved with Local 1430, we will do our best to earn back your trust. Please know we are all one team and need to focus on how we can keep improving our culture and operations together. 

We are committed not only to listening and taking action, on the feedback from our drivers, and also reigniting the [redacted] culture and values in a way that resonates with our drivers. We highly value our drivers for their talents, skills, and tenure that they bring to work every day. ""

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Makes me wonder how effective union leadership may have been.
> 
>> **Commenter 2:** Honestly it's likely more of an indication of how dumb and gullible your average truck driver is. I used to have to interact with these people for work and it's insane that we entrust these people with massive machines.
>> 
>> For some odd reason HVAC and truck driving seems to attract just the bottom of the barrel dipshit. Seems to be the trend on reddit too, you see a brain dead far right conservative take it's going to be someone who's also active on trucker subreddits half the time.
>>> **Commenter 3:** A TON of union workers listen to anti-union conservative propaganda and think they'll be better off without the union. I'm in a major union plant and you see Trump and Let's Go Brandon gear everywhere.
>>> 
>>> These people permeate the membership rolls, committees, and leadership positions. Our unions are under threat from within. Our local union FB page is a stream of conservative content or replies.
>>>> 
>>>> **OOP:** OMG, this is so true. I was a Union VP for over 10 yrs and a member for over 17. He's already looking for other work.

**Commenter 1:** Putting your trust in your employer is some top tier foolishness
> **Commenter 2:** The OP says that almost every driver at this company are retired UPS drivers. Probably the 72 that decided to leave the union... they already have full Teamsters benefits & pension, so fuck everyone else! They don't want to pay union dues because their pension & paycheck aren't enough..
> 
> Just another case of the senior members screwing the younger members.
>> 
>> **OOP:** Not drivers, the management team is made up of retired UPS drivers (25 yr tenure) who have their full benefits and healthcare. They brainwashed alot of the immigrant drivers to vote the Union out. They'd speak to them in their respective languages and literally just have them nodding their heads.

**Commenter:** You know it would be real shame if 33 drivers went out and found new jobs. I'm gonna bet a nickle that the other 72 get the old you gotta do the extra shifts for no OT. We are family.

> **OOP:** Oh, that is definitely happening. Hubby has 2 interviews already lined up this week.

[Update](https://new.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1eu1a8k/update_my_husbands_job_convinced_their_truck/): **August 16, 2024**

I said it from the beginning. They were going to start letting people go for BS reasons and hire people at lower wages.

My husband who voted against the companies interest was let go today. They can now terminate you at will. The reason for letting him go you may ask. Complaining about the working conditions since they got rid of the Union.

**Edit: Since I guess maybe I didn‚Äôt write it correctly, my husband who is Pro Union voted against the company asking to remove the Union. He voted ‚Äúagainst the best interest of the company‚Äù. If you read my previous post, you‚Äôll see the company letter they sent when they asked truckers to ‚Äútrust them‚Äù.

**Additional Information from OOP**

> **OOP:** Let me explain. When the drivers voted, the results were literally divided by old employees to new hire. The company knew who had voted to retain the Union. My husband is friends with the former steward, who‚Äôs also a driver. The guys were having a lot of route, scheduling and other problems.
> 
> Yeah, once or twice or maybe thrice, they lamented loudly they missed the Union due to the lack of support they now had from the company. All of those guys have been slowly let go: We lost a route (lie) You‚Äôre not keeping up like we need you too, while giving the employees extra customers and complaining when they don‚Äôt get back to base early enough. Not Qualified any longer? No pints, DUI or tickets???? Yeah BS but that‚Äôs NYC

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** Hope he can find a union shop for his next job.

> **OOP:** I‚Äôm on it!! I‚Äôm a Union girl all the way.

**Commenter:** If they actually gave that as a reason, there might be a case for wrongful termination, expecially if the working conditions were in violation of any law.

Also, due to that, he might be eligable for unemployment.

> **OOP:** They didn‚Äôt say that directly to him. They‚Äôre dumb, but not that dumb. But everyone knew. They started getting rid of the drivers that were making a lot of OT. They had restaurants on routes that only wanted the experienced drivers as they didn‚Äôt have to watch what they did or put things. They went in & usually had to help the inexperienced drivers with theirs. Literally they have maybe 10 drivers that have been there longer than my husband now. The company employs over 150 at this location. Now most of the new guys are leaving as soon as they see how hard it is. It‚Äôs a revolving door of employees now. He can collect but it‚Äôll never be the same as his take home was, plus the medical benefits we just now lost.

**Commenter:** So, they voted to dissolve the thing that gave them collective bargaining power to willfully submit to the employer's arbitrary whims? And they fell for that?

> **OOP:** Yup. The letter they gave my husband when the vote passed is up on my previous post. He worked hard with the steward and the longer employed drivers, but the new hires were like ‚Äúmore money in my check‚Äù. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

AITA for moving out because I don‚Äôt want to help my bf out with the rent?,"My boyfriend(26M) and I(24F) have been together for 3 years. We live in NYC and he makes over $200k/year, while I‚Äôm studying for my masters in social work and have no income. Right now I‚Äôm doing an unpaid, yearlong internship 3 days/week, as well as classes 2 days/week. It‚Äôs rare to get a paid internship in social work, plus internships are mandatory. I spend 12 hours everyday either working, studying, commuting, or in class. My only free days are on weekends so I have no time for a paid job. My mom helps me financially by paying for my metrocard and healthcare expenses, but everything else I rely on loans.

Before I moved in with my boyfriend there was a roach infestation in my apartment so I'd stay over at his place a lot. My lease was ending soon so he asked me if I wanted to live with him. At first I joked with him that his living standards would go down since I can‚Äôt afford a nice place, but he insisted on paying the rent until I finish grad school, then we would split the rent based on income. I originally wanted to live in a cheaper place in Queens or Brooklyn, but my boyfriend likes his current place and insisted I move in since he would be the one paying the rent. So I moved into his $5k/month luxury condo in the city this August.

All of a sudden my boyfriend recently started asking me to pay half the rent ($2.5k/month). I was confused because he was the one who wanted to pay the rent in full. Apparently he was talking to his friends and they all think its weird that I don‚Äôt pay rent and that I was a gold digger. I let my boyfriend know that I can‚Äôt afford $2.5k/month and he said I was ‚Äúleeching‚Äù off of him, so I told him that he should find someone within his social class so he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about a gold digger like me leeching off of him. I stayed at my friends place for a few days while figuring out what to do.

I called my mom about my situation and she is willing to help me out but the maximum she can afford for rent is $800. I found some places in Queens within the price range, less than 15 min away from the city and a bus ride away from my school so I went to check them out a couple days ago. I‚Äôve been texting the landlord and my new roommates and I already signed the lease. I told my boyfriend about my new place and he got upset and asked me to stay. He said that he was willing to accept $800/month instead of $2.5k/month if thats all I can afford, but I told him I don‚Äôt want him changing his mind again and demanding more money from me in the future.

He lived in this condo alone for several years so it‚Äôs not like he can‚Äôt afford to live there without my help. I wouldn‚Äôt mind splitting rent with him, but I would have to live in a more affordable place outside of Manhattan like I originally wanted.

Apparently some of our ‚Äúmutual friends‚Äù think I‚Äôm being unreasonable for moving out instead of talking to him and staying by paying the amount I can afford in rent, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have let him pay my portion of the rent.

update: yes i did dump him. i blocked him and his idiot friends on everything. My friends also blocked him since he tried to contact me through them. i'm going to enjoy being single and never relying on a man financially ever again.

update #2: i'm going to make a few clarifications since a lot of you are confused and clearly aren't familiar with NYC.

1. yes, it is possible to find a room for $800 in queens when you have several roommates. but my room is small as shit, has no AC (which obviously isn't an issue now but will be in the summer) and is above a restaurant which means i'll probably have rodent roomies (my current roommate told me that they did have a rat problem in the past but it's supposedly fixed. However, knowing these mutant city rats i know they'll come back), but this is the best i can do for now. I'm not some new, bright eyed transplant who thinks NYC is only the trendy and rich parts of manhattan so i know where to look.
2. In general, NYC landlords have a 40x rent rule. Landlords that accept guarantors follow the 80x rule, but some landlords are more lenient when it comes to students. My landlord's son is also an alumni of the school I'm currently attending and is from the same cultural/ethnic background as me which probably gave me some leverage, along with the fact that my mom meets the 80x requirement. It also took me a week to find my current place.
3. I just started my 2-year MSW program this September. I finished undergrad 2.5 years ago and worked full time before starting my masters degree. So yes, I did have a job and paid my own rent (which was $1,025/month for a roach infested apartment in queens that i shared with a roommate.) I obviously don't have time to work now due to my schedule. My place was not rent stabilized (I'm confused as to how some of you came to this conclusion) it was cheap because it was a shitty place and no one wants to live there.
4. Yes, my ex does make that much money. It's NYC, he's been in the workforce for 5 years and people here make more money than they would in whatever town you're from, especially in his field. It was initially shocking to me that someone with just a bachelors could earn that much while contributing absolutely nothing to society but that's life.

There's a 3,000 character limit so it's hard to include everything. My original post got deleted since i exceeded the limit and i had to delete a lot of information to get this post approved. The last thing i need right now is non NYCers from the rest of bumfuck America trying to have some sort of weird gotcha moment because they think sex and the city and rich transplants on social media is representative of the real NYC.",19207,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ycqv7x/aita_for_moving_out_because_i_dont_want_to_help/
"OOP: My [29/F] BF[32 M] ""gave"" away my Hamilton tickets, am I being selfish for just wanting to break up over this?","**I am NOT OP. Original post June 14 2016 by u/confusedtheatergeek**

very short update

---

&nbsp;

[**My [29/F] BF[32 M] ""gave"" away my Hamilton tickets, am I being selfish for just wanting to break up over this?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/4o3opw/my_29f_bf32_m_gave_away_my_hamilton_tickets_am_i/)

Throwaway because while I'm fairly sure he/his family doesn't reddit I would rather be safe than sorry.

Backstory: My mom is genuinely one of the funniest, kindest, sweetest people I've ever met and I'm genuinely lucky to have been her daughter. She had me fairly young, raised me by herself and while we were pretty poor growing up, she did her damndest to make sure that I got a good education and had everything I needed as a kid.

One of the things we share is a love of the theater. She would save up and take me to all the musicals that stopped on tour in our town and while we were always in the cheap seats it was always something we both greatly looked forward to. These memories of going to the theater with my mom are very precious to me and is one of the main factors in why I work in the entertainment industry today (corporate side, I have a horrendous singing voice lol).

Fastforward to today. Like most theater nerds, my mom and I are basically obsessed with Hamilton. And for those of you who aren't really familiar with it, this show is basically impossible to get tickets for at this point, unless you want to see it in January of next year. I'm lucky enough to be in a financial position w/my job that I could afford tickets for a show in July for me and my mom. These are amazing seats (fifth row center), and through some type of divine intervention I managed to snag tickets for the night that Lin Manuel Miranda's (creator/lead in Hamilton) final performance. I surprised my mom with these tickets back in December (i bought them in october i think) for christmas. I'm making a whole week of it, I put us up in a really nice hotel, i made reservations at a bunch of restaurants that we both want to try, and we're going to do a bunch of touristy shit in general (plus try to see if we can fit in at least one other show before we leave). We are both incredibly excited for this, my mom even has a little Hamilton countdown that she's doing on a mini chalkboard she uses as a planner. She sends me pics every day when she changes it, it's cute.

In January, I began dating this guy that I'll refer to as Josh. We were casual/not exclusive for a while but became serious within the last two month. He also works in the corporate side of entertainment, but at a different agency than I do. He also has a higher position than me, and makes a loooot more money than I do (this becomes important). We met at an industry event and we hit it off instantly. I thought I could get really serious about this guy and up to this point there have been no red flags that I've seen (although tbh right now I'm sifting through all of my memories to see if there's something I missed). He also comes from a much much wealthier family than I do.

Josh has a younger sister that I'll call Jennifer (17) that's kind of going through a big troubled teen phase. She cuts class, smokes, and is really disrespectful to her parents. I‚Äôve only met her once but as far as I know, she's not doing anything too bad she's just kind of a sad kid and could really benefit from some therapy (I floated this by Josh but he said his parents are kind of disdainful of therapy in general). Josh says they can't reach out to her no matter what they do and they've tried everything (except trying to get her to a counselor but whatever).

Actual problem time: Sunday night I was at my place with Josh. We were drinking wine and cuddling while watching the tony's (theater awards show). My mom was texting me during the Hamilton performance and geeking out about how excited she was. I laughed and showed my mom's texts to Josh because I thought it was so adorable, and he didn't say anything off but he was acting kind of strange after. He asked me what date the show we were going to was, I told him and then he went into the other room to take a phone call. I thought nothing of it because we both have to take random phone calls like that for our jobs all the time and he's going through kind of a tough time at his. He was in an unusually good mood afterwards and said he had to go home early because he had to ""sign some forms at the office early tomorrow"" before we met up to get brunch with his parents later that day. Again, nothing too unusual and pretty common with the both of us.

He picks me up at work for the brunch with his parents and again he‚Äôs in an unusually good mood. I ask what‚Äôs up and he says vaguely that things are going well at the office and this deal he‚Äôs trying to make is finally going through. I don‚Äôt really press for info bc we both try to avoid work topics (partially due to work shit being fairly banal and partially bc we both have to sign some pretty gnarly NDA‚Äôs a lot of the time) and this is only my second time meeting his parents so I‚Äôm still a bit nervous about brunch. We get to the brunch place and the first thing his mom does when she sees me is give me a huge, warm hug and profoundly thanks me for my kindness. Her dad also gives me a huge handshake and thanks me for ‚Äúhelping out with Jen‚Äù. I‚Äôm kind of wtfing because I have no clue what they‚Äôre talking about. I ask what she means and she says for giving her the Hamilton tickets. I turn around to Josh and he just has this big grin on his face.

Reddit, that time my boyfriend was away talking on the phone for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù he was actually on the phone with Jen promising that I would give her my Hamilton tickets! I was so thrown off by this that I (kind of not very tactfully, I admit) say how I had no clue about this. Josh looks pissed, and his parents are equally thrown off. But instead of getting mad at Josh his mom just says ‚ÄúWell, you can still give them to her though right?‚Äù And they all look at me like I‚Äôm supposed to just agree with this. And I try to explain that the trip is actually for me and my mom, and how important this is to my mom. All three of them start going on about how Jen is ‚Äúsuper excited about this‚Äù and that this is the first time that she‚Äôs not been mad/expressed happiness to them in a while. And that‚Äôs how the next half hour goes basically, until the parents leave, mad, and the dad calls me a selfish cow. I‚Äôm so flabbergasted that I just sort of put up with it, but I could barely get in a word.

Josh and I go outside the brunch place and he starts screaming at me about my selfishness, and how Jen is going through a much harder time than they thought (he wasn‚Äôt very clear on this so I‚Äôm not quite sure what he meant), and that I‚Äôm being childish because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a musical‚Äù. I haaaate having arguments in public (also this is one of my favorite brunch spots and I wanted to be able to come back without being embarrassed) so I wasn‚Äôt really engaging. He eventually called me a cunt (wtf????) and then left in his car (which is awkward as hell because it was valet parking so he was just kind of stewing by the valet stand while I was waiting for my Uber). Later that night I texted him saying while I wasn‚Äôt giving up my tickets there are still some available on that date. However, they cost about $2,500 due to ticket scalpers jacking up the price. Believe me, this is NOT a problem for either the parents or my boyfriend (he literally bought a $3k watch for funsies last week). The only response I got was that that was an exorbitant fee (I agree but not the point), he refuses to pay and he didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt just give the tickets to Jen. I also got texts from both his parents pleading with me to get the tickets and also they forwarded an e-mail to me that Jen sent to Josh and her parents for thanking them for the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù. Apparently she‚Äôs also obsessed with Hamilton and this is making her year. Also we live in LA, do they also expect me to give up my plane ticket/hotel? Wtf was their gameplan here?

Look, I completely understand wanting to help out with Jen and I feel really bad that apparently her family is filled with weirdos, but this has been all so baffling and the entitled behavior they displayed is a massive turn off. I am not giving up these tickets(is this selfish?), but I also kind of want to cut my losses here. The attitude Josh displayed towards me outside of the brunch place was very unpleasant to say the least, and he knows how disrespectful I find being called a cunt so I‚Äôm of half a mind to just break up with him. He knew I had these tickets for a while, and I don‚Äôt get why he decided to do this now at all. But should I contact Jen and explain at all? I just saw that she made a really excited post on Facebook about it (I‚Äôm not friends with her but I am friends with my bf and he liked her post). I would straight up buy the ticket for her but frankly I can‚Äôt afford those prices bc I‚Äôm saving up for the NYC trip for my mom. How do I move forward?

TLDR My boyfriend offered/‚Äùgave‚Äù my Hamilton tickets to his troubled sister without my knowledge and now he and his parents are massively pissed at me bc I won‚Äôt give them to her. Should I just cut my losses?

Yeah, I'm typing up an e-mail dumping him right now. Normally I think it's better to meet up irl for things like this but his behavior both during and outside brunch was scary and I would prefer not to be alone w/him right now (maybe that's paranoid but better safe than sorry). I think this is one of those situations where everything was so crazy and they were acting like this is totally normal behavior that I thought I was the insane one.

"100+ Speakeasies, Hidden Bars & Restaurants in NYC","Hi,

New Yorkers love having a drink behind a secret door or going to a bar with no sign, so I made a map of them. ""Hidden"" is a bit of a loose term, and can be hard to define, but the vast majority of these are your speakeasy type places. I'm sure I am missing about 100 more so drop them in the comments - especially the ones I've labeled in black - and I will add them!

I blind taste-tested Rao's and Carbone's marinara against homemade marinara,"I've gotten in the habit of buying Rao's pasta sauces in the last few years, and when I saw that fancy-pants NYC red-sauce restaurant Carbone had a supermarket brand, I thought, I should try this. Then, when we had guests coming over, I thought, we should do a taste test.  

I cooked a big batch of rigatoni in salted water, drained it and divided it into five pots, and tossed each over a warm burner with about 3/4 cup warmed sauce and about 2 Tb pasta water for about 3 minutes. Not precise, not identical pots, but not terrible. My wife and our guest did not know what was what, but I did.

The contestants were:

1. Rao's marinara
2. Carbone's marinara
3. [Cook's Illustrated homemade marinara](https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes/2895-marinara-sauce) made with Cento San Marzano whole tomatoes
4. [Marcella Hazan's onion and butter marinara](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/tomato-sauce-onion-and-butter) made with Cento petite diced tomatoes 
5. Our guest's homemade sauce (didn't ask any questions) 

Long story short, my wife and I both picked Marcella Hazan's sauce hands-down. My guest picked Cook's Illustrated marinara, which is significantly more effort to cook. I thought Carbone was distinctly better than Rao's, which I thought was too sweet.  My wife and guest were indifferent between the two.

I can think of a half-dozen ways I could have made this test more rigorous with a little more prep time and/or a commercial kitchen, but as is, it seemed good enough for a Reddit post.",3353,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1adzffz/i_blind_tastetested_raos_and_carbones_marinara/
Seattle Delivery Prices,"The takeaway is that niche focused app seems to be the best option. 

The whole purpose of this post is to share one data point analysis that I done. When searching for posts of similar topics, they are usually a screen shot of some other click bait work or a comparison of how a $10 McDonald‚Äôs order turns into a $40 meal. That is not very applicable to me because I do not order a lot of McDonald‚Äôs and I would never order delivery from the clown / king. 

I lived most of my life in nyc (right in the middle of Manhattan). In comparison, nyc food is cheaper and better. Just my opinion. I also didn‚Äôt move to Seattle for food. I came for nature and been very happy!

I was blown away by the delivery prices here because I used to order 3-5 times a week in New York. Sure I paid some fees but generally very reasonable (5-10%) of subtotal, including tips. Sometimes even less with promotions. 

I dont know what will be the future of delivery in Seattle. At the current prices, I would not be ordering any meals, maybe niche apps. Either the apps come down with their fees or they cure me of my slight delivery addiction. Kinda win win for me. 

Just want to share this in case someone else is looking to order Chinese food and want to the skip 10min comparing all the apps. 

Note 1: I am out of Tony‚Äôs delivery so I could not try his service

Note 2: I actually never been to the restaurant in person so I do not know it‚Äôs in store prices. I assume they are closer to Fantuan but not sure. Yelp menu pages with these items are also outdated. ",1477,https://i.redd.it/hku5iqqtx5wd1.jpeg
Scottsdale pizza joint in 2004 - anyone remember this old restaurant? NYC style pizza slices,"This is a long shot, but I'm trying to remember the name of a wonderful old pizzeria that's probably been closed for 20 years, it was on Scottsdale Road (east side of the street) south of Thomas Road.  I used to work in the area way back in 2004, and would go there a lot for lunch.  They served this delicious NYC-style thin crust pizza, by the slice or the whole pie.  Definitely not a chain, just a local hole-in-the-wall type place but MAN was this ever good!  Do any long-time PHX residents remember the name of this random departed pizza joint by chance?

update: could it have been ""Petro's Chicago Pizza"" or ""Italiano Brothers"" where the D'Lite Healthy restaurant is found right now in 2024?

Suburban sprawl makes the US a terrible place to live,"I have dual US-EU citizenship so I've lived in both. I couldn't get over having to drive anywhere and the US landscape being dominated by huge roads and parking lots so I moved back to Europe.

Now I don't own a car but I can get anywhere in the city in about half an hour thanks to an abundance of tram, bus and metro stops everywhere within walking distance and arriving every few minutes. I step outside my apartment building and the nearest grocery store and tram stop are 2 minutes away by foot along with countless restaurants. I like being able to walk through the city center and seeing life all around me. The equivalent in the US would be a trip to the mall or Walmart.

Compared to Europe the vast majority of the US is a barren landscape of parking lots and big box stores. It's not conducive to mental health and well-being.

The average American spends $700 per month on their car, not to mention the cost of maintaining all those roads. I don't buy the argument that suburban sprawl and driving 2 miles to the nearest grocery store is more efficient, especially considering it will get more expensive as the supply of cheap fossil fuel dwindles.

I understand that there are many Americans who prefer living in suburbia, the problem is that there's no real alternative for those of us who prefer city life besides a few rare exceptions like NYC and maybe Boston. I get depressed by the thought of living in suburbia with lifeless streets and needing a car to go anywhere.

The caveat for most Americans would probably be that most people here live in apartments, even families with children. I actually prefer it though because no way do I want to deal with having to maintain a lawn and yard. My apartment is 215 square feet, but it's all the space I need for a place to sleep, shower and eat.

The top picture is where I live now compared to the type of urban environment that surrounded me in the US. (note: The point of this comparison is not about the pretty old buildings but the efficient use of space. Even if the buildings were all grey boxes I would still prefer the layout.)

https://i.imgur.com/UQvMnfS.jpg

Picture of what a typical street looks like here. People live in those buildings while shops and restaurants are on the ground floor. Public transport goes through the whole city, no need to own a car.

https://i.imgur.com/aOUVilj.jpg

I should clarify that when I say ""terrible place to live"", I mean terrible for people who want to live in a dense urban environment bustling with activity and life, and hate the hassle of owning and driving a car.

**Edit: After doing a lot of reflecting the past day I've changed my mind and concluded that American suburbs are perfect for what they offer if you want a peaceful and spacious place to raise a family and the convenience of driving everywhere. However, at this stage in my life and I want to live in a lively urban setting full of adventure and I don't think the US offers enough of that. I also realize that this type of bustling urban environment is only possible if most of the people living in the city don't own a car, because the amount of space needed for parking would lead to sprawl and then it wouldn't be a dense city anymore.**",16853,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/ser87k/suburban_sprawl_makes_the_us_a_terrible_place_to/

Planning a foodie vacation to Michelin star restaurants in NYC for a week. Any recommendations?,"My original plan was to fly to Vegas and spend 5-7 days eating at all the great restaurants there, but since I live 15 min away from NYC, I thought I could get more bang for my buck by just heading into the city and eating at a bunch of Michelin star or equivalent restaurants. I have no idea where to begin, though. My only previous experience was at Gramercy Tavern in 2016, which was amazing. My one restriction is that the person I'm going to be dining with doesn't like seafood. I'm open to anything but Per Se. It's a bit out of my price range. The budget for Vegas was 3k, and I'd like to spend somewhat less if possible.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your wonderful recommendations! So far from my own research, I'm really liking Crown Shy and Rezdora.

What I love about the weightloss in the US ,"I am from Europe (Prague üá®üáø) - born and raised, and for the last 4 years I‚Äôve been coming to the US (NYC) on a regular basis for work, staying up to 6 months at a time. I lost 30 LBS (250->220) almost effortlessly.

Here are things that helped me as opposed to losing weight in Europe. 

1) Many fastfood restaurants / chains have calories listed on the menu - I eat healthy but maybe allow myself a fast-food once or twice a week. Makes tracking so easy. 

2) Portion sizes are bigger and it is just perfect for IF regime eating twice a day - two big portions a day (lunch and dinner), skip breakfast. If you don‚Äôt IF, just order small portion (which is regular portion in Europe). 

3) Trader‚Äôs Joe‚Äôs / Aldi‚Äôs frozen foods section
Tired after work? You have access to amazing frozen meals if you don‚Äôt wanna cook. Be smart about the sodium intake, and you have some delicious options!

4) Loseit / other reddit communities
Feeling like buying low carb mac n cheese? Ask reddit and your fellow Americans will bend over backwards to tell you about which mac n cheese has the best macros, where to buy it, how to cook it, what to combine it with, etc - all this information is served on a silver platter to you tested by thousands of people. Good luck searching for something like this in a smaller European city. I literally had to go to every supermarket and check out all the products on my own until I found my favorites - very exhausting (and sometimes demotivating, lmao)

5) Variety - insane variety of foods from all the nations imaginable. Million vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, low carb options. 

6) Community that mostly supports you
You think body shaming is bad? Try Eastern European body shaming. Or try getting a compliment for being active and trying to get in shape. Try getting a random compliment on your tennis forehand during a tennis match. You guys are one of the nicest people that exist in terms of sport activities, nutrition, weightloss and fitness.Not that it is crucial, but from an outsider‚Äôs pov the general fitness / sport / nutrition community is motivational and supportive so much. I‚Äôve only been punched up, never punched down by the community. (Anecdotal, curious if other people share my opinion here)

By this post I just want to commend America for how great it is in terms of food variety - don‚Äôt get me wrong - there are huge issues with your nutrition (for instance it takes a lot of time to find normal bread that is not full of sugar). But if you decide to count calories, are smart about your nutrition, do basic movement and exercise, then this country is heaven. I realize that I might speak from a privileged pov - no food desserts in NYC, no need to commute an hour to wallmart, etc.
But generally I am so happy everytime I need to travel to the US because I know I‚Äôm gonna enjoy finding amazing food options with good calorie counts and lose weight.

India is expensive,"**Please stop raging. This is the usual lifestyle for any upper middle class in Singapore, Jakrata, Dubai, Berlin, London, New Jersey or San Jose. For a moderately compentent fellow who could have been anywhere, and has been to a few places this is not abnormal aspiration.**   


I have had the fortune of living in a 2-3 counties for an extended period of time. I have come to realise that India is not cheap if you aspire to live an upper middle class lifestyle.

My definition of upper middle class lifestyle is -

1. Should be able to replace Sofa, Fridge, Washing Machine,A/C, TV etc whenever they die, without batting an eyelid.
2. Should be able to get on a flight to see parents/familiy/friends without stressing over ticket prices (imagine you best friend is in ICU).
3. Top of the line gadgets for me and family (iPhones and MacBooks) - Replace every 4-5 years.
4. Couple of vacations (7-10 days each) - Goa every time doesn‚Äôt work. Sometimes it should be Croatia or Bali.
5. A good car that you replace every 5-6 years (This is my sin, I like driving). And this is where Indian government hurts the most.
6. Lack of worry for major healthcare expenses - A decent insurance coverage for family of 4 will be at least Rs 120,000 per year. Taken out of taxes in most European countries. So, I guess it‚Äôs equal.

Major monthly expenses:

Rent - 3 bed apartment in India (Rs 60,000 - Rs 80,000) - PS - This is non-Bombay rent. Let's not bring in NYC, London as a comparision. For those who own the diffrence is between 9% homeloan interest rate vs 5% mortgage rate, thats a story of another time.

School for 2 kids - Rs 60,000-80,000 per month

Groceries and utilities - Rs 40,000 ( good groceries are expensive, I don‚Äôt want to risk it with sewage washed veggies and antibiotic injected poultry/mutton)

Eating out and entertainment- Rs 30,000 - 40,000 (Again eat out a mid-high restaurants with a few drinks).

Just adding the above the expenses are ballpark of Rs 2lac to 3 lac per month (there are other expenses that I haven't listed). So, India is not exactly cheap if you want a upper middle class lifestyle.

I was forced to eat at fancy restaurants for a month $$$,"Many years ago, I got put on a work assignment for months that required me to travel to New York City and stay every Monday to Friday. I was assisting a company manager with a project and my hotel was near his regular office in the Theater District.

If you are not familiar, the Theater District is heavily built for tourists. Restaurants are generally kind of fancy and expensive. There were really not any quick and cheap options for dining in that area. The company had a generous meal policy of up to $30-40 meal for travel expenses. I did use that for a bit, but the food got to feeling too indulgent and kind of ridiculous given it was an extended assignment. Also I was working really long hours and did not want to go sit in restaurants- I just wanted to go watch tv and sleep in my room.

So after the first week or so, I instead went to a grocery store on Monday night. I bought some basics for cereal, sandwiches and snacks, and some frozen meals I could microwave for lunch in the office. It cost about $60. I then took a few cans of soda from my hotel fridge to make room for my weekly food purchase , and returned them before checking out at the end of the week. And that was it for food costs, with an occasional meal out here or there. I did the same the next four weeks, submitted my expense report at the end of the month. You know where this is going‚Ä¶

A lady from accounting called, and refused to reimburse my expenses because $60 is more than $40, the max allowance for a meal purchase. I explained that had covered 5 days of food but was told it didn‚Äôt matter.

I then spent the next month trying all the food in the neighborhood. There really were not any cheap options. I went out to eat a few mornings, lunch whenever I found time, and dinner absolutely every day. I could have bought a few installments of groceries but the once/week shopping convenience was part of why I‚Äôd wanted them. It had also seemed wasteful for me to go out for an expensive meal every night for long term travel, but now I‚Äôd been told that was preferred by accounting to my grocery bills!

The next month, I got a call from my NYC manager asking how I‚Äôd run through more budget every week of the month than the entire month before combined. I explained the grocery situation, and he thanked me and hung up. About 10 minutes later, that same lady from accounting called me to tell be they‚Äôd pay my still-not-reimbursed grocery bill and any going forward as long as the daily amount averaged for the week was under the aggregate meal allowance. 

I happily returned to a more reasonable diet.",33463,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/sxivxh/i_was_forced_to_eat_at_fancy_restaurants_for_a/
After leaving Europe I'm finding it hard to enjoy the US,"I spent most of the summer railing around Europe and spent time in many cities I've never been. I feel I really got into the lifestyle there. Sitting outside to eat on summer nights. Walking and taking transit everywhere. Seeing people outside everywhere partaking in the city. Enjoying the historic charm that is in abundance, feeling safe everywhere at all hours(maybe with the exception of Marseilles and parts of London), etc. 

I feel like the US in comparison is just...underwhelming. I currently live in Nashville and most of my life have lived in Los Angeles. I want to move to a new city but really don't like any city in the US enough to be excited about going there. And it seems the only places in America that might give you a slice of that European lifestyle are prohibitively expensive, like San Francisco or NYC.

I feel like most Americans cities are sprawling, bland, built around cars, terrible transit, unsafe. A few years ago I was walking through downtown Atlanta on a weekend in the afternoon and was stunned that there were no people walking other than me. It was like the city had been abandoned. I could not imagine the center of a European city being completely empty of pedestrians. There is more vibrancy in a European city of 200,000 than in an American city of 2 million. 

After the architectural splendor of Prague and Edinburgh. the Mediterranean charm of old town Nice, eating in the medieval alleyways of Croatia, I come back to America and feel kind of depressed at the landscape of strip malls, drive-thru Starbucks, urban blight, sprawling suburbs with cookie cutter houses and no sidewalks or pedestrians in sight. Maybe one little historic ""old town"" street downtown that you have to drive into and that's full of souvenir shops and chain restaurants. 

I guess I'm just ranting and experiencing post-vacation blues, but I'm missing the European lifestyle so much it hurts and I'm having difficulty adjusting to America. I liked just about every European city I visited. There are very few American cities I'd bother visiting unless I had a specific reason to go there. 

On the plus side, the variety of natural scenery in the US, particularly the western US rivals anything in Europe and maybe surpasses it. And increasingly I'd rather rent a cabin in some place like the Smoky Mountains or Sierras in California than visit the cities.",6629,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/y1h4au/after_leaving_europe_im_finding_it_hard_to_enjoy/

AITA for moving out because I don‚Äôt want to help my bf out with the rent?," \**I am NOT OOP. Original post by* [u/idiotrichboyfriend/](https://www.reddit.com/user/idiotrichboyfriend/) in r/AmItheAsshole

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ycqv7x/aita_for_moving_out_because_i_dont_want_to_help/) **10/26/22**

My  boyfriend(26M) and I(24F) have been together for 3 years. We live in  NYC and he makes over $200k/year, while I‚Äôm studying for my masters in social work and have no income. Right now I‚Äôm doing an unpaid, yearlong  internship 3 days/week, as well as classes 2 days/week. It‚Äôs rare to get  a paid internship in social work, plus internships are mandatory. I  spend 12 hours everyday either working, studying, commuting, or in  class. My only free days are on weekends so I have no time for a paid  job. My mom helps me financially by paying for my metrocard and  healthcare expenses, but everything else I rely on loans.

Before  I moved in with my boyfriend there was a roach infestation in my  apartment so I'd stay over at his place a lot. My lease was ending soon  so he asked me if I wanted to live with him. At first I joked with him  that his living standards would go down since I can‚Äôt afford a nice  place, but he insisted on paying the rent until I finish grad school,  then we would split the rent based on income. I originally wanted to  live in a cheaper place in Queens or Brooklyn, but my boyfriend likes  his current place and insisted I move in since he would be the one  paying the rent. So I moved into his $5k/month luxury condo in the city  this August.

All of a sudden my  boyfriend recently started asking me to pay half the rent ($2.5k/month).  I was confused because he was the one who wanted to pay the rent in  full. Apparently he was talking to his friends and they all think its  weird that I don‚Äôt pay rent and that I was a gold digger. I let my  boyfriend know that I can‚Äôt afford $2.5k/month and he said I was  ‚Äúleeching‚Äù off of him, so I told him that he should find someone within  his social class so he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about a gold digger like me  leeching off of him. I stayed at my friends place for a few days while  figuring out what to do.

I called  my mom about my situation and she is willing to help me out but the  maximum she can afford for rent is $800. I found some places in Queens  within the price range, less than 15 min away from the city and a bus  ride away from my school so I went to check them out a couple days ago.  I‚Äôve been texting the landlord and my new roommates and I already signed  the lease. I told my boyfriend about my new place and he got upset and  asked me to stay. He said that he was willing to accept $800/month  instead of $2.5k/month if thats all I can afford, but I told him I don‚Äôt  want him changing his mind again and demanding more money from me in  the future.

He lived in this condo  alone for several years so it‚Äôs not like he can‚Äôt afford to live there  without my help. I wouldn‚Äôt mind splitting rent with him, but I would  have to live in a more affordable place outside of Manhattan like I  originally wanted.

Apparently some  of our ‚Äúmutual friends‚Äù think I‚Äôm being unreasonable for moving out  instead of talking to him and staying by paying the amount I can afford  in rent, and that I shouldn‚Äôt have let him pay my portion of the rent.

**UPDATES within original post**

***update:***  yes i did dump him. i blocked him and his idiot friends on everything.  My friends also blocked him since he tried to contact me through them.  i'm going to enjoy being single and never relying on a man financially  ever again.

***update #2:*** i'm going to make a few clarifications since a lot of you are confused and clearly aren't familiar with NYC.

1. yes,  it is possible to find a room for $800 in queens when you have several  roommates. but my room is small as shit, has no AC (which obviously  isn't an issue now but will be in the summer) and is above a restaurant  which means i'll probably have rodent roomies (my current roommate told  me that they did have a rat problem in the past but it's supposedly  fixed. However, knowing these mutant city rats i know they'll come  back), but this is the best i can do for now. I'm not some new, bright  eyed transplant who thinks NYC is only the trendy and rich parts of  manhattan so i know where to look.
2. In  general, NYC landlords have a 40x rent rule. Landlords that accept  guarantors follow the 80x rule, but some landlords are more lenient when  it comes to students. My landlord's son is also an alumni of the school  I'm currently attending and is from the same cultural/ethnic background  as me which probably gave me some leverage, along with the fact that my  mom meets the 80x requirement. It also took me a week to find my  current place.
3. I  just started my 2-year MSW program this September. I finished undergrad  2.5 years ago and worked full time before starting my masters degree.  So yes, I did have a job and paid my own rent (which was $1,025/month  for a roach infested apartment in queens that i shared with a roommate.)  I obviously don't have time to work now due to my schedule. My place  was not rent stabilized (I'm confused as to how some of you came to this  conclusion) it was cheap because it was a shitty place and no one wants  to live there.
4. Yes,  my ex does make that much money. It's NYC, he's been in the workforce  for 5 years and people here make more money than they would in whatever  town you're from, especially in his field. It was initially shocking to  me that someone with just a bachelors could earn that much while  contributing absolutely nothing to society but that's life.

There's  a 3,000 character limit so it's hard to include everything. My original  post got deleted since i exceeded the limit and i had to delete a lot  of information to get this post approved. The last thing i need right  now is non NYCers from the rest of bumfuck America trying to have some  sort of weird gotcha moment because they think sex and the city and rich  transplants on social media is representative of the real NYC.

"Girl tried to move in after one date, packed her stuff while she was gone and left her scrambling","Here‚Äôs the OP: https://www.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/16n9we3/be_honest_here_am_i_getting_murdered/

tl:dr Hot girl messaged me and wants to meet up, but suddenly tells me she has an emergency and asked if she could stay with me or have me book her a hotel. 

Update:

So, against my better judgement, we met up. I decided to do a lunch date, so it wasn‚Äôt that expensive. Except she wanted me to Uber her there. This is NYC, and even I use the subway, but ok. 

She shows up, and immediately she looks different. Not like catfish level, but her picture was heavily airbrushed and edited. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs an 8 in the pictures but 4-5 in person. Red flag. But we‚Äôre already at the restaurant and she has a great body, and I‚Äôm a guy. So fine. 

Turns out, she‚Äôs Russian, and apparently got a green card through her ‚Äúuncle‚Äù in Texas. However, she‚Äôs visiting NYC and likes it. Her friend who offered her 8 days of stay could only let her stay for 6 days yada yada yada, she needs a place to stay. 

I told her I‚Äôm uncomfortable with having a stranger stay with me, but she said she really likes me and wanna see how it goes. So decision point, against my better judgment, I said fine, she can stay for a day or two, but I told her I only have one bed, she can take the sofa if she‚Äôs wants, but she says she‚Äôs really attracted to me and don‚Äôt mind sharing a bed (again, little man won). 

So she goes and brings her luggage, turns out she had two huge luggage‚Äôs. And immediately after showing her my apartment, I told her she can get settled in and join my when she‚Äôs done. Then she essentially locked herself in my room ‚Äúshowering‚Äù for two hours. At this point I‚Äôm nervous.

After two hours, I knocked on the door and she said she‚Äôs almost done and opened up. Turns out ‚Äúsettle in‚Äù means she took everything out and basically settled into my room. I‚Äôm concerned at this point. BUT, she walks out with a very thin night gown and started getting all handsy with me. Lovely. 

We ended up making out with some heavy petting for like 3 hours, but just when I thought we were gonna get it on, she stopped and she said she doesn‚Äôt do it on the first date and she needs to be in a long term relationship for sex. At this point, I told her, I‚Äôm fine with her being there just for the night, but I need to talk to her tomorrow about the situation. 

Well, tomorrow comes, and she zooms out as I was making breakfast and said she‚Äôs meeting some friends. So that was prime opportunity, I packed all her stuff, brought it downstairs to the doorman, and told her to pick them up that night. As you can imagine, she flipped. She went from being mad, to asking me for a hotel room, to putting a curse on me, to saying I stole her stuff, to saying she‚Äôll call the police. 

tl:dr Didn‚Äôt listen to Reddit. Met up with her, she tried to move in, and I packed her stuff when she left. She flipped out. I was down maybe $70 for lunch and Uber but had a pretty fun time before craziness started. Overall, kinda fun experience (?). 

https://imgur.com/a/VZ8E8NC

Edit: So some people are saying this isn't really petty revenge, I just managed to avoid a catastrophe. I didn't add that I packed her stuff at noon, then went out, enjoy the day, had dinner, then messaged her about 7pm to tell her to pick her stuff up. I thought it was a little mean, and was ashamed of it, but this is r/pettyrevenge, and it was pretty petty, so it fits lol.",4353,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/16pk2c3/girl_tried_to_move_in_after_one_date_packed_her/

100+ Hidden Bars & Restaurants in NYC,"Hi,

New Yorkers love having a drink behind a door or going to a bar with no sign, so I made a map of them.  ""Hidden"" is a bit of a loose term, and can be hard to define, but the vast majority of these are your speakeasy type places.  I'm sure I am missing about 100 more so drop them in the comments - especially the ones I've labeled in black - and I will add them!

LA and NYC‚Äôs impending vaccine passports mean that a majority of Black people will no longer be allowed inside restaurants,"The impending vaccine passports in Los Angeles and New York City will disproportionately affect Black people. 

And it‚Äôs much more than just restaurants. Both vaccine passport proposals preclude the unvaccinated from bars, gyms, spas, movie theaters, stadiums, and concert venues, while the Los Angeles proposal also broadly includes ‚Äúretail establishments.‚Äù  [Los Angeles officials terrifyingly state](https://abc7.com/la-vaccine-mandate-nyc-new-york-city-los-angeles/10929542/) that ‚Äúno determination‚Äù has been made if that includes even *grocery stores*. 


Both [Los Angeles](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm) and [New York City](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-vaccines.page) have robust vaccine dashboards. The following table has the percentage of those who have received at least 1 dose of a vaccine in each locality by race. As you can see, in Los Angeles, Hispanic people are also disproportionately less vaccinated than Whites.


Race | % 1+ Dose in LA | % 1+ Dose in NY 
---------|----------|----------
Asian | 78% | 87% 
Black | 48% | 44% 
Hispanic| 57% | 61%
Native American | 67% | 87%
White | 67% | 57%
(*NOTE: LA data is for those 12+ as of 8/6/21, while NY data is for those 18+ as of 8/11/21. Here are screenshots of the [LA](https://i.imgur.com/fRD6Lfv.png) and [NYC](https://i.imgur.com/ZtmPY0y.png) tables from the respective dashboards.*)

Additionally, LA has a [graph](https://i.imgur.com/2sdzmhD.png) of the percentage of each race vaccinated over time. You can see that the disparities among Blacks and Hispanics compared to Whites and Asians begins almost immediately. And by April, the pace of Hispanic vaccinations starts to quickly outpace Black vaccinations (as does the pace of Asian vaccinations compared to White vaccinations). 

NYC does not break down vaccinations over time by race, and only has a general [graph](https://i.imgur.com/DwOZ0kj.png) of administered doses that shows the same recent plateauing.  NYC does, however, provide a more [comprehensive breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/FwaJXWx.png) by age and by borough.


For all the talk nowadays about race, and how all racial disparities are always caused by systemic racism and must be fixed, there‚Äôs very little pushback on these vaccine passports (everyone knows the best way to convince a population historically distrustful of the government to do something is for the government to force them to do it).

This is yet another example of the privileged class seeking to protect themselves by screwing over working-class minorities, who never had the luxury of working from home, and are often now too afraid of missing work to get the vaccine (as [one article](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-12/california-should-mandate-covid-vaccines-but-there-is-one-problem) explained: ‚Äú20% of employees said that they hadn‚Äôt gotten vaccinated yet, either because they were afraid of missing work or were too busy ‚Äî a percentage that jumped to 40% for Latino workers and 26% for Black workers.‚Äù).

On the other hand, LA‚Äôs new woke District Attorney is [no longer prosecuting trespassing or resisting arrest](https://abc7.com/george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-lada-misdemeanor-crimes/8674095/), so maybe they can just get away with flouting the vaccine requirements.",327,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/p38cer/la_and_nycs_impending_vaccine_passports_mean_that/

when they were leaving, I went up to ask for a picture and they were genuinely so sweet and lovely. i was very much surprised/delighted (despite knowing that all men on southern charm are objectively trash). craig told me that he hoped I liked the restaurant and my stoned ass said something wise like ‚Äúyeah we‚Äôll see I guess‚Äù and then asked him when his spot is opening‚Ä¶ üëÅÔ∏èüëÖüëÅÔ∏è
