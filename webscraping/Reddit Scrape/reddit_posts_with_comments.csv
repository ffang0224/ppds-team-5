"A few Thanksgiving sandwiches: Brown Bag, Poulet Sans Tête, Lenwich",,"[Brown Bag Sandwich Co.](https://www.brownbagny.com/)

Great stuff here!  One of the few Thanksgiving-type sandwiches I've seen that had mashed potatoes.  The cranberry came on a bit strong for my tastes, but the sandwich was so good overall that I can't truly complain.  I was skeptical about how well the stuffing-flavored chips would work instead of actual stuffing, but you know what, they did.  They make only 30 of these in a day so don't get there too late!  Potato salad was damn fine too, and I'm super curious about the rest of [their menu](https://i.imgur.com/TfgncYj.jpg).

[Poulet Sans Tête](https://www.pouletsanstete.com/)

As good as Brown Bag was, though, this was better.  Best one I've had in the city, no exaggeration, and the damn thing doesn't even have turkey, it's chicken.  The stuffing was the highlight for me, clearly made onsite, robust shrooms/veggies.  The spread of cranberry was appropriately thin, didn't overtake things.  That's chicken au jus at the bottom, which I alternately dipped and spooned on.  Just excellent, and while only the UWS location has it, it's  a mere few minutes up on the 1.  Maybe I'll try and petition them to bring it to the WV.

Yeah, don't bother. | poulet sans tete is delicious | Lenwich is so terrible. | Shout out to u/hannahrosie196 for the rec on that one | It was so fucking gross lol I just happened to be by the one at Union Square, and I was like eh, whatever.  My mistake"
Help. Looking for an amazing restaurant to highlight my NYC trip. ,"Im looking for a Michelin star/ high-end  restaurant to highlight my nyc trip with friends. I don't prefer the   ones where they give and elaborate presentation with tiny foods dishes.

There will be 4 adults maybe 5 and 2 older kids/teens. Well mannered but still minors. So something that admits kids.

Food taste over all maters. Budget is flexible. Fine with reservations.

Also looking for awesome non-fancy-schmancy restaurants in general. 

I Love trying foods! I heard there was a bunch of italian/ African and Hispanic foods in NYC . Not picky on style. just dont wanna spend $14  for a normal hot dog. lol

 I heard pastrami was delicious . I really want to try that.

Side note: Ill be around time square. Is travel hard? How's transportation?  Should I just get day subway passes? First time in NYC. Is it really that crazy/busy?",

Solo diners ,"Curious if anyone else has had issues eating out alone. 

I often eat out alone and go to all sorts of restaurants. Lately, I’ve been feeling neglected. Like they seat me and barely come back. I feel like a bother? I’ve left three place within the past two months after apps because they never came back to see if I wanted anything else. 

Wondering if anyone has suggestions on places where they are down for a solo diner? 

(First time poster)","I dine solo a lot, once in awhile you get the vibe that you’re not being prioritized but most of the time it’s fine, I feel like it’s pretty common in NYC. As others have said, nice places tend to be particularly attentive to solo diners. The last couple places I had a particularly great time dining solo were Agi’s Counter and The Otter in soho. Last place I got a bad vibe was Lilia, it’s like they wanted to physically rush me out ASAP. | Pretty sure Minetta Tavern gives you a free glass of champagne if you're dining alone. | When people go out to restaurants, do they not do their entire order at the start? Like you order your apps/entree/drinks right at the start, and when you're done with your apps, your entree comes out and then the waiter/waitress comes back later to check to see if everything is okay and if you want desserts.

If you're leaving after just appetizers, I'm assuming that you only ordered an appetizer and no entree.

I've never waited tables before but I feel like if someone just ordered an appetizer and nothing else, I would assume that they're not interested in getting an entree so there's no reason to check up on the table as often unless if their drink is getting low or if they want the bill. | I have experienced this several places being a solo diner it frankly makes me not want to go out. One place refused to acknowledge me at the bar, and I had eaten there previously. Higher end expensive places are usually pretty good if not great service but I’m not always wanting to spend $100+. Im a woman if that matters. | Always treated well at Vinyl Steakhouse, The  Bar at the Modern, and Oceana | I’ve found if you make a reservation, they tend to respect the solo diner a bit more. But it’s a restaurant by restaurant thing. The trend is for more solo diners so I believe more restaurants will begin to accommodate that crowd. | I go solo to Bar Moga all the time and sit at the bar. I was treated well Day One and have been going back for over three years now.

Otis in Bushwick has also treated me well the few times I have visited.

On the other hand, I dined solo at Khe-Yo once (closed now) and was ignored and mistreated. It really depends on where you go I think. Sorry to hear you have had generally poor experiences. I always felt NYC treats solo diners better than other cities. | I found sitting at the bar is great for solo dining! You get attention / better service sometimes ! | sitting at bar is always great for solo diners | I eat solo alot and have never had this experience even once | Dining solo has been fine for me.

Here’s some recommended places from 1 day ago: [Best places to eat alone (counter)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gu4rg7/best_places_to_eat_alone_counter/). Most agree you can still eat solo anywhere. 

Are you looking for any specific cuisines or foods? | Ichiran is nice for solo dining if you’re into ramen! \^\^


The waitstaff are trained to come to you at the press of a button (speaking from experience, I used to work there) if you need to order anything, and there are self-serve water dispensers down the aisle. They give you special small plates to put on the button for if you want extra noodles, or when you’re ready to pay so that you skip the extra step and get what you need right away. Tip is also included in the price. The only drawback is how loud it can get if it’s busy. | 100% for copyright reasons! | I often dine alone and sometimes I want to enjoy a cocktail before the food comes out. Never again will I trust someone who says they know how to course it out. I’ve had app and entree show up before I’m finished with my cocktail Sitting at the bar is always a better experience as a solo diner for me. | I go to NY and eat solo all the time. Haven't had an issue yet. I have had your sort of issue in Toronto though, usually at bars. They act like I'm a nuisance and I have to chase someone down if I want another drink. Even if I'm at the bar with a bartender close by. They are talking to someone else or just walk by me. What, you don't want to make more money? Toronto has more shit service overall than NYC, I've found. | ive worked in nyc bars and restaurants 10+ years.  solo diners are the lowest maintenance and spend the most money per hour.  larger parties take more time and spend less per person.  they want to seat you.  so if they say they can't, then they can't or theyre stuffy mishlin types and you should go back and do a ""pretty woman."" | 9/10 dudes sitting solo are 45 minutes early for a tinder date.  have you tried facing the entrance and making brief awkward eye contact with everyone who enters? | I'm from Chicago, and have frequently dined out on my own and usually have a good experience, typically I do sit at the bar though and order some wine. However, I recently went to New York for work and had an experience similar to what you're describing - I started out with some oysters but after that it was like they totally forgot about me even with an empty wine glass in front of me. I assumed it was because the dinner rush came in, but now I'm wondering if maybe different areas aren't used to solo diners.

I did have a good experience dining alone i NY at Serafina on Broad St though! | Agi’s counter was a good one for me too, forgot about it because I moved out of the area. Arden is another good place where I was always treated good and good for solo dining. Leland Eating and Drinking House is another great one. | Balthazar used to, not sure if they still do | yes very solo dining friendly | Do you live in NYC/the US? (Not being a dick, genuinely asking)

Some restaurants prefer you put in your whole order at the start, but in my experience the majority of places take a drink/apps order, then apps order if you didn’t place any before, then dinner, then dessert (all in separate visits to the table). | Theres lots of indecisive people out there who would order an app and then realize they also want an entree. Or what if theres something wrong with the app? Someone should always be checking in at some point of the meal and not just towards the end. | I was going to say the same thing. Usually enjoy eating at the bar when going solo cause it makes it easier to chat with someone and makes service better | Found the Crown Heights crowd bc I love Leland and Agis. Bar seating, glass of wine, with my book and the vibes are perfect. 10/10 | agree, depends on if im ready, sometimes i order all at once other times separately, also depends on if i know if a place is slow or too fast etc | I wouldn't say it's the majority, if anything it's the opposite - in NYC far more in other cities I've found restaurants want you to put your whole order in upfront. | Born and raised in NYC.

I've always to put in my entire order at a time and have rarely/never order the apps first, wait for the apps to arrive, finish eating the apps and then wait to order my entree. Everyone else I've dine with have also done the same so I'm surprised people are ordering the entree and appetizers separately.

To me, it seems kind of like an asshole move as a solo diner, especially if you're taking up a table for 2 and when the restaurant is busy.

Like you get seated at the restaurant, take 5-10 minutes to look over the menu and order your drinks/appetizer. Wait another 10 minutes for the appetizer to be made. Another 5-10 minutes to eat your appetizer and then put in your order for your entree? Does it really take like 20+ minutes to figure out what entree you want?

At the worst case scenario, just put in the order when they drop off the appetizer, it shouldn't take 20+ minutes to figure out what you want for your entree unless if you're dining at the Cheesecake Factory where they have a 20 page menu. | I always order appetiser and entree together. I’m British, and this is what I grew up doing, but I’ve never been told off for doing it here. | I moved to a different neighborhood that sucks - am going to move back there when my lease is up. | I like to test the waters and see if I really want to commit to an entree at the place | Agreed o/ If I *did* want more time to think about entrees, I’d let the waiter know I’m holding onto the menu to think about it, and be prepared to tell them the rest of my order once they drop off any food. | When I order at once, some places will bring app and entree at the same time or bring the entree before the app, which I find infuriating."

Looking for suggestions for cheap but good places to eat,"Need some suggestions with good food and atmosphere. I am gonna be solo and can travel around the Manhattan area with the underground (Living near MSG). Up to 40$ if the food is really good and filling.

Take-aways and dine ins are both welcome!

","> Up to 40$ if the food is really good and filling.

That's a pretty reasonable budget for most normal restaurants, especially if you aren't buying fancy drinks - NYC isn't *that* expensive.  You're going to need to be more specific. | Abiko curry or BCD tofu house in K Town | This spot is fantastic, though I’m not sure how peanut allergy friendly they are https://maps.app.goo.gl/Rr5eSN9Fj18WkPTJA?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy | Los Tacos No. 1 and Los Mariscos @ Chelsea Market | For that price point I second the other comments. Food carts, pizza, taco, bagel, and dim sum spots are your jam. Luckily there’s plenty of delicious options! 

Birria-Landia, Los tacos No 1 for tacos 
Mamas too for pizza
Pretty much anywhere in Chinatown for dumplings

If you want something a little “fancier”, Tamarind Tribeca, which is a pretty nice Indian restaurant has a weekday lunch offer for $36. It doesn’t include beverage, tax or tip so calculate that in but it could be a good option if you want a slightly more “upscale” experience for around $50. | BD halal fits the bill | Spicy village | Cheap in NYC. Just go to any diner, you can get cheapish filling food. Cheaper options exist though. Street food carts are good option. Grey's Papaya for hot dogs. You could try E. 6th street or Lexington above Grammercy for cheap Indian/Pakistani lunches. You can find Latino deli's that do cheap plates, think stuff like rice and beans with a piece of roast chicken. | Dessert at grace street if you want to be near MSG | I've also had the Kati Roll Company (Indian kati rolls, midtown) and Margon (Cuban sandwiches, midtown) on my list for a while!

Soho reccos - pasta,"I'm visiting with my mum, we're staying in Soho.

I need a couple of reccommendations please:

1. a fantastic bowl of pasta on our first night. Needs to be near our hotel (Soho Grand), cosy and relaxed. I have a booking for Piccola Cucina Osteria, but heard mixed reviews.
2. a brunch on Sunday - is Bubby's worth the hype?

Other reccos for the area welcome, especially for pizza, bagels, coffees and must eats.

edit: thank you, love these. For ref we live in London and Dubai so are pretty spoilt with food options - I’ll be avoiding anything that has outposts back home, would prefer New York one offs!

Thank you xxx","**Some spots near the hotel:**

[Lucia Pizza of SOHO](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uEWdrpa94gdiHL9o8) is down the block from your hotel. It's an outpost of a [old school pizza shop in Brooklyn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CbvZ9Yv381YJtkWRA) that's been opened since the 1970s, so definitely a must try since it's down the block.

[Flippers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N6pgPNNrxZmqs6A78) is a chain from Japan and they specialize in those Japanese fluffy pancakes and they're down the block. I've been there and personally wasn't the biggest fan of fluffy pancakes but worth a try if you've never had it.

[Dominique Ansel Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qxefqAjHjz3dNLrq5) is a famous bakery known for inventing or popularizing the ""cronut"" (crossiant/donut). IDK how fast the cronut sells out nowadays but you can [preorder them online](https://www.cronutpreorder.com/) a week ahead of time for pickup. They have a different flavor of cronut every month and supposedly they have never repeated a flavor.

Their other pastries/baked goods are pretty cool too. Some people say the cronut is overhyped but I actually like their cronut a lot, and all the imitation ones that I've tried from other bakeries are not as good. It's not worth the initial hype (years ago) where people were waiting in line before they opened and it was sold out within the first hour but it's definitely worth a try now that the hype has died down.

[Raku](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wVCw2TTU3V2BtAbq5) has one of the best (beef?) udon in the city, it should not be missed.

[Ladurée](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pPLzUa6HxmUWGi8d6) is a famous pastry shop from France, known for their macarons. They have tea and food too but I've only ever had their teas and macarons.

[Sunrise Mart ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kZCENSZxY1a2xzGN7)is a Japanese grocery store and would be a good spot to hit up for Japanese snacks and noms.

[Hamburger America ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i2qycCmaMTxs5LXHA)is the new social media darling spot for smashed burgers. Love the gimicky old school diner vibe but the onion burger I got from there was disgustingly bland. I sat at the counter where you can watch the guy make the burgers in front of you and I'm 90% sure that he didn't add any seasoning because it tasted like cardboard.

I have legit never had such bland food in my life. Sometimes I forget to season food when I cook at home and it had more flavor than the burger they served me. I legit didn't understand how the burger was so tasteless.

The smash burgers I make at home taste better but maybe I just got a newbie chef on a bad day or something. The shoestring fries were okay, tasted like McDonalds fries, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because I love McDonalds fries but it's not anything special lol.

\---

You're also right by Chinatown. Tons of cheap and good eats in Chinatown. If it's good weather, you want to do a mini food tour, [here's a bunch of small eats](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/uvejl1/comment/i9li61p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) you can check out.

If you want a sit down spot, [Noodle Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Zokt7aQj7iX6YoEg7) has one of the best wonton noodle soup in the city. The other stuff on their menu is also very solid/good.

[Canal Street Market ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/de59zaEXVRWxPqd27)might be worth a quick 5 min walk through for lunch. They have a food hall and a bunch of vendors selling things.

[Pearl River Mart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sdk9Zn4ZC3LgK1t38) is a neat Chinatown gift shop that's been around since the '70s. | 1. Pepolino. It’s a block from the Soho Grand and a nice, non pretentious cozy place with good pastas. 

2. I would say no. If you want a sceney brunch place in the area, Jacks Wife Freda would be more contemporary at a moderate price range. | San Carlo Osteria Piemonte at Spring and Thompson. Very well executed menu and a great wine list. 
Bubby’s is great if you haven’t been there but I love smaller places like Buvette, Jeffrey’s Grocery, Joseph Leonard for cocktails and brunch | Because you live in dubai and london where fine dining and indian food scene there are great, my suggestions are more nyc centric:

Katz

Junior's 

atomix

jung sik

cote

l'artusi

l'industrie

63 clinton

grand central oyster bar

flex mussels | Osteria Carlina Tribeca for pasta | Really solid list. I do have to say I have been so disappointed in the trajectory of Canal Street Market. A couple fine options but a ghost town compared to its peak."
Better burger at Red Hook Tavern or Minetta Tavern?,I'll be visiting NYC and want to try an iconic burger. So far these are the two that stand out to me that also seem relatively accessible. Which do folks prefer?,"One thing to keep in mind, getting to red hook tavern is a bit of a pain, and takes a lot of time. If you’re looking to maximize the rest of your day, my reco would 100% be minetta | Different. I personally prefer Minetta. But both are fantastic. | Love the sear on the RHT burger but also love the caramelized onions on the MT burger. Didn’t particularly love either of their fries (you get much more at MT though), but they were never going to be the star of the show. You truly can’t go wrong! 

Also would recommend looking into Lord’s — they have an excellent burger AND fries! | Best burger will always be up to you, so ideally try both, but that may he unrealistic so: Minetta is the way to go.

As a Chicagoan I plead for you to ignore the calls for Au Cheval. It's not that good even in the original,  and the NYC location feels soulless and drab. | Red hook and fuck what other folks said about red hook it is one of the most photogenic old new york neighborhoods as an added bonus get there early enough that you can get a delfontes sandwich or go by Ferdinandos and stop for some traditional Sicilian street food . Head up to mazzolas bakery and buy some lard bread | Was on work trip got Minetta burger and bone marrow. No regrets...yet haha. Make sure to not get it past medium. | This may be a bit of a hot take given the rankings, etc... but I've had both Red Hook Tavern and Minetta multiple times... and Peter Luger is miles better than both. | I prefer Minettas black label burger and its much more centrally located! | Minetta.   Personal preference.  Love both | Red hook | I’ve had both and answer is absolutely red hook. Minetta was unbelievably disappointing | corner bistro | Gramercy tavern | Red hook if you prefer raw onion, minetta if you prefer caramelized onion. Otherwise they're very similar imo. | You’ve got sufficient advice on convenience, accessibility etc so regarding the actual two burgers (I’ll limit to the two proposed and not go into other high regarded burgers): 


RHT kitchen is run by the same people that do Hometown BBQ, they use a blend of dry aged strip and chuck, the fat content is pretty high for for a tavern/pub style patty, you’ve got a slice of American, white onion and a toasted seeded bun. 
I’d consider the patty to be pretty heavily seasoned.  

Minettas black label (not the minetta burger) burger is butter basted, made from rib-eye, uses caramelised onions and is served on a brioche (not a very sweet bun) the cheese is Vermont cheddar  

RHT is the quintessential cheeseburger - heavily inspired by Lugers lunch menu offering cheeseburger - if you’re after an emphasis on beef flavour this should be the better fit. The black label burger is probably the better whole package but less emphasis on the pure meat. | Au Cheval. You won’t regret it. | I made the trek out to RHT after wanting to try their burger for months; unfortunately it was sooo salty. Def recommend Minetta. Lots more to do in the area too, although Strong Rope brewing in RH is great. | Red Hook Tavern. Go to Other Half and Raaka afterwards. | Jg melon is pretty damn good | Minetta hands down | Minetta tavern all day | I'd do Minetta and then try TWO iconic burgers. | I've had red hook about 5x now...had minetta once...if that tells you anything about my recommendation. I personally would rather hit hamburger America than minetta...this is again personal preference of the restaurants.

There's also hometown BBQ (same owner as red hook) down the block, still my favorite BBQ in NYC. | Minetta has the best burger in NYC. No contest. Also the restaurant is better experience. | Recently had RHT burger for the first time with several of my friends and we were all pretty disappointed by it! It’s a fine burger but didn’t live up to the hype sadly. 

Minetta was way better, not sure if it’s my favorite burger in the city (I think I go 4 Charles) but it’s def up there! | Go to Minetta y’all, I’ll keep RHT to myself | red hook | There’s a hole in the wall joint called “burger world”. It is actually fire | Here we go again | Eating at the bar at Minetta is one of New York's best dining experiences. The burger is amazing and just a bonus! | Red Hook Tavern > Minetta Tavern any time.

But Minetta for the vibes, locale, everything else. | I think the best is at Au Cheval | Red Hook without a doubt | Peter Luger | Jackson hole is really good too. | Burger - RHT. Fries - Mintetta. | If you do Minetta, you have to get the bone marrow with it. The burger alone is meh, but topped with bone marrow makes it worth it. Otherwise I agree with someone else who said to do Peter Luger during lunch for one of their burgers. Far superior. | Honestly, if you're looking for a good modern burger there are better options. 7th Street Burger, Rolo's (bit further out), chopped cheese, or heck even the original Shake Shack in MSP.

Minetta Tavern and Peter Lugers are both kind of dry and crumbly. Red Hook Tavern is good but still standard steakhouse fare. | The correct answer is “The Nines” | Not worth the travel to Red Hook unless you’re already below Atlantic Ave | jackson hole | 7th Street Burgers > everything else | Skinflints beats them both. | Burgers are very boring | Good point. I'm staying in the Flatiron District so Minetta seems much more accessible. | 100% this OP. Plus there frankly isn’t much else to do out in Red Hook, certainly compared to the area MT is in. | Lord's is the best in the city, bar none, imho. | I second all of this. | Lords is great | went there and couldnt eat more than 2 bites, gross ass greaseball burger | Ate there in Chicago and was like...what?  Its like Shake Shack whose burgers are also trash. | Nothing personal, Red Hook is an incredible neighborhood (had a Defonte's sandwich at Valentino Pier for lunch yesterday), but for a visitor on a time budget Minetta is the answer. | Brooklyn French bakers is a different vibe but definitely worth a visit too | Peter Luger is the best burger I've had anywhere, and I have tried many of them.  It gets overshadowed, probably because it is lunch-only at a restaurant that many consider not worth the price for its dinner offerings. | To each their own, but I really disagree here.  The burger really lacked flavor compared to Minetta, Red Hook, Au Cheval, and others. | This! | That’s probably the most detail oriented and knowledge based answer I have read for a while.

Thank you! I’m not an OP, but I know now Minetta would be my pick. | Is the one in NYC better? Au Cheval isn't even the best in their own neighborhood in Chicago. | Same. I have had them all and Au Cheval condiments and cheese make it a great burger | Au Cheval is way better than Minetta IMHO. | Lions bar finally berthed my top | This is the right answer. Better than both. | Meh - its mostly just big and greasy, I don’t think its anything special.  The meat is tasteless, their fries suck, the real reason to go there is breakfast and Goodfellas. | Jackson hole is great, but not even close to as good as either Minetta or RHT. | Is that a joke?  Not even in the same league as the quality of meat used in the two under consideration. | Taste is subjective but if we’re in the quality league of RHT and MT this burger doesn’t even rank. No way | Skinflints makes a great burger... I had one as recently last week.  I really like that they use an english muffin.

That said, it doesn't compare to the Red Hook Tavern burger, IMO, and I don't think it is intended to.

The RHT burger is sort of the ideal, simple, but elevated burger to me.

The skinflints burger is very good, and is perfectly suited to its role on their menu.  You'd never want to have an RHT pizza burger, but the skiflints formula works perfectly for that. | Burgers are my favorite | Oh, youre so edgy!  So contrarian and cool. | This is dumb. Did you know that it's possible to like burgers as well as all of the other cuisines NY has to offer? | Probably true for a visitor. Although recently had a really fun day taking the ferry from downtown to Gov Island for a bit, then to Red Hook (drops you off super close to the tavern). Then some key lime pies and enjoying all the great bars there too

Definitely will be back for sure, easy to get to since I live downtown and no tourists to be found | wtf are you going on about with “nothing much else to do in red hook?” There’s amazing bars, breweries, art galleries, dessert places… | Don’t listen to this user. 

Red hook is a charming neighborhood and is close to Carroll Gardens and other vibrant communities that you can make a day out of. 

Red Hook has Pioneer Works which throws some of the best events and has some of the best arts in the city. 

The bar scene is fun and intimate, there’s one of the best record stores in the city down there with a lot of local performers. Great food and arts culture.

I actually say it's a lot more chill and enjoyable than the NYU overrun area that MT is in.

But both burgers are very good, I prefer Red Hook's burger and the overall experience more, but I also have been to MacDougal street over a hundred times. | Yep, agreed with papaya. I love spending a day down in red hook. Hometown bbq to bk crab to Sunny’s bar is the standard circuit. But I live in Brooklyn, and that’s a full day down there with a crew when it’s sunny and warm out. 

Unless you have hours to spare, which someone visiting nyc likely doesn’t, it just isn’t the move to go all that way to try a burger. No matter how good. | On the other hand, Red Hook does have Sunnys. And frankly the cocktail bars on Smith and Atlantic areas are better than anything by Minetta. And they're more accessible too.

Which reminds me Long Island Bar has a great burger and excellent cocktails.

With that said, Red Hook Tavern and Minetta are my faves. Do prefer the vibe at Minetta. But I just don't really like that neighborhood. | Couldn't have said it better myself. | I finally tried that burger last year and wow. | Haha.  Agreed. | Came here to say this. Au Cheval burger > Minetta burger | You’re going to a major international city with some of the greatest cuisine in the world and you are curious about a burger? | Nothing edgy about it.  You like children’s food. That’s cool | I enjoy red hook quite a bit. But frankly if this person is a tourist visiting from the Midwest or something for a short period of time they’re probably better off staying around the central part of Manhattan if they want to maximize their time here and the typical tourist stuff. | Dude definitely doesn’t get to Brooklyn much lmao.. | Steve’s Key Lime Pie! Almost, if not equally, as good as Kermit’s in Key West -former Floridian | Look man, I'm sure Red Hook is awesome, but if you're visiting from Minnesota then your time would be better spent in the Village than in an out-of-the-way neighborhood, regardless of how charming it is. | My point is why as a tourist do the things that all the other tourists do wait in lines for things that aren’t worth it pay huge amounts of money for things that aren’t worth it why not have a more authentic more interesting experience go see the best skyline view in new york , go see greenwood cemetery go see the things that made new york new York rather than all this new new york bullshit take a day to see Brooklyn (certainly not even a thousandth of what would be required) go to red hook go to Carrol gardens go to sunset and brooklyn Chinatown go to sheepshead bay and get on an evening fishing party boat and see new york the way local people see new york | ya | Oh, BURRRN!!!  You got me!  Ouch! | I think it depends on the vibe you're going for! I take my family that love to party and eat around Gowanus/RH/Carroll Gardens a lot more than the Village, because they don't like how busy/raucous those areas are. The village skews incredibly young and busy, which might not be for everyone. Crowded sidewalks and inebriated college kids with lines for every jazz/comedy show isn't for everyone.

They have great comedy at the bell house, right near RH Tavern, without all the fuss of the Cellar or fat black pussycat. Record Shop in RH has great music on a lot of nights. Public Records is quite the scene and has a more hip flair than spots in the village. There's a lot of great pizza in that region of BK with baby luc's, coal 87, giuseppina's, lucali etc.

Pioneer Works is also a super interesting stop that most skip over. I enjoy it more than most museums in the city, especially if you're going for one of their events.

While the village is easier to get to, a lot of the experiences can feel claustrophobic and busy/loud. Maybe I'm jaded because I went to school in the village, but I was just trying to say there's a lot to see and do in that region of BK, and making a day of it wouldn't be a bad idea. | Don't disagree. I live by there. Red Hook and Carroll Gardens are great neighborhoods to visit as a tourist. | Go to Mountain House in the East Village. Good Szechuan food.  Much better than a burger | Apparently I did. Enjoy your chicken tenders and Mac and cheese | nah | Also delicious. Nothing wrong with tendies and Mac and cheese. | Lol szechuan is not exactly the culinary heights either mr fancy pants.. | Cool. You seem adventurous | You called them tendies. That’s so sweet little snookum. You’re not only culinarily 5 but you’re emotionally the same age. So cute | I offered up something with flavor. Sorry.  Enjoy your pablum Mr baby pants | thanks | Lmao. I know you're great fun at parties."
Best Thanksgiving Caterer? ,"Hi, I’m in charge of looking for a caterer this year for Thanksgiving (first time…)! It’s pretty daunting as we usually don’t eat the traditional Thanksgiving food and I now have to find a place that caters exactly that. Does anyone have a place that they recommend? ",
ISO good German food in nyc,"Hi everyone! I’m headed to NYC this December and I’m looking for some good, authentic German food. I went to Germany last year and visited a bunch of Christmas markets. While in Bamberg, I ate many a handbrot and fell in love with them. If anyone knows of spots that make them in NYC, pls drop them below!! 
Thanks in advance :)","We're not exactly heavily stocked with German food, and I've never seen the item in question.

There's a little bit up in what is left of Yorkville with the Heidelberg (ancient and classic) and Schaller & Weber's Stube (new and cool, but Schaller & Weber have been around forever, wonderful option for cold cuts, wursts and random other butcher shop adjacent things).

There're a couple random options in Manhattan (only Hofbräu pops into mind tbh).

There's Zum Stammtisch way the fuck out in Queens (lovely place, not worth the commute for a tourist), and Manor Oktoberfest with similar statements of not going out there.

The holiday markets will have a few German (or near German) offerings and are well worth going through at least one (Bryant Park is my pick), but again, never seen a handbrot.

The closest thing to it that you might find here would be a pinwheel from a pizzeria (I've seen ham and cheese ones, but peperoni is clearly the correct answer). | There’s a Hofbräu house in midtown. It’s similar  but not exact  as their other locations around the US. They serve a variety of pub food and traditional German./Bavarian.  Prob not the best around but good enough. | \^ You pretty much said it all.

RIP Zum Schneider and Wechsler's."
Cheese. Give it to me. ,"I’m gonna be in NYC for a few days with my girlfriend. This woman is a cheese fiend. She lives and dies for cheese. 

I want to do something romantic for her while we’re there. I want to take her to some kind of cheese-based establishment (perhaps also one with salami) and tell her to go nuts like a kid in a candy store buying all the cheese she wants. Alternatively, I’d like to take her to a nice sit down place and treat her to the best most bombastic charcuterie board that the world has ever seen alongside cocktails. 

Reddit please, pretty please, with a cherry on top — help me be the best boyfriend ever. Give me the cheese. ","This is a recent [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1go5f5l/are_there_any_restaurants_or_shops_that_sell_a/) that's worth looking at especially for your sit down charcuterie question, but you might want to take a look at these spots:


* **Murray's** - pretty much the GOAT in NYC, everyone will say Murray's

* **Eataly** - nice cheese, mostly Italian, but definitely not limited to Italian cheeses

* **Bedford Cheese Shop**

* **Astoria Bier and Cheese Collective** - also sit down for beer and cheese and meat boards

* **Formaggio Kitchen** 

* **Wegman's** - actually has a fairly decent selection of nice meats and cheeses, though not as extensive as some of these other places | Obvious easy answer: Murray's Cheese.  The West Village location has some seating, wine, and the ability to get a cheese board for one.  Or you can just buy a shit load, a bottle of wine, and go pig out in your hotel room.  No matter what, go there, she'll be happy as a pig in a cheese shop (I'm not trying to say your GF is a pig, I just wanted a silly turn on the normal phrase...).

[This thread from last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1go5f5l/are_there_any_restaurants_or_shops_that_sell_a/) has a lot of good suggestions.

But I feel like there's probably a better answer out there for ""Fuckit, let's make her happy, here is a ridiculous spread and some great booze"", sadly I don't have a great answer.  Some good bar has to have a banging shark coochy board (disclaimer before someone else says it: charcuterie is cured/preserved meats, a board with that and cheese is not technically a charcuterie board, but fuck anyone that tries to gatekeep that shit).

Another option would be a good French restaurant where you can finish a romantic meal w/ cheese.  Near Murray's you could look at Minetta Tavern, La Sirene, Buvette and probably a few more. | Get her the cheese advent calendar at Murray’s. | If you have time, consider going to a Georgian restaurant and trying some cheese-based dishes. NYC has a lot of really great Georgian restaurants with a variety of Georgian cheeses. The ones in Manhattan (e.g., Chama Mama, Ubani, Cheeseboat, Oda House, etc) will be more expensive than restaurants or bakeries in south Brooklyn, but they are delicious. | Agree that Murray’s is the GOAT. but another fun option, in addition to fondue and raclette already mentioned, is something like cheese boat in HK. Nothing like a fine French cheese, but their Georgian cheese bread things are pretty tasty. | Murray’s West Village

Murray’s West Village

Murray’s West Village

Eat in (make reservations) or take out.

These folks know what they are doing. | Murray’s is great, but I have a soft spot for Saxelby’s in Chelsea Market. Anne Saxelby was an extraordinary ambassador for American farmstead cheeses, and her book The New Rules of Cheese is a great gift. | Would she enjoy a fondue or raclette experience?

I personally have not had either at a restaurant here and have done them at home, but there are bound to be spots. Laveaux in the West Village for fondue I think, and then that crazy raclette sandwich place at the Bryant Park winter market. | There’s Murray’s in that food market inside Grand Central, that’s probably the best selection I know about, and there’s other purveyors right there with salami and breads. Also Eataly in Madison Park (Flatiron) and in FiDi at 4 WTC, and lastly there’s a good cheese shop in Essex Market. My go to would be Grand Central | Add 67 Gourmet (on Columbus) to your list.  67 Wines is across the street to pick a pairing or two 

Near Central Park if the weather is nice, too | Maybe S'Mac for mac and cheese. There's a small, cheapo fancy cheese selection at jacks sometimes as well. | Zabars for the cheese selection and everything else. | I’ve never been but there’s a place in Williamsburg called [cheeseboat](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SVzEhLoin6CAJNXS7?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) that looks super cute and they serve these cheese boats that she might be into | Eataly for cheese and their wine bar in the middle of the market. | GOAT of cheese haha🐐 🧀 | You can also check their website for cheese classes! | Haha I also suggested their Hell’s Kitchen location"

Veal Parmesan at Allora NYC (2 locations),"Full disclaimer.. my husband ordered this, not me 😀. The verdict.. the veal was amazing. Pounded thin but not too thin and perfectly cooked. The sauce was great. It came with tapas of burrata & penne, peppers, some cured meats, and fried eggplant. Everything was amazing, except the cheese. There's obviously too much cheese. That said, it's an easy fix. Great dish and he gave it an A-.

https://www.alloraristorantenyc.com/","Personal Opinion: that does not look appetising whatsoever…  

Anyone been to Allora and can share their experience/opinion? | I thoroughly enjoyed the veal parm at Michael’s of brooklyn. Great nostalgic red sauce place where the phone is actually still ringing off the hookup on a Sunday. “Don’t answer it, that’s Phyllis letting us know that she’s 10minutes late.” | Looks like they tried to make a pizza on a plate instead of dough | Gimme 10 rolls and 15 minutes | >Everything was amazing, except the cheese. There's obviously too much cheese.

I'm glad you said it. I took one look at that photo and thought, ""What did you people do to that beautiful veal?!"" | Less mozz, more Romano | Veal Parmesan sandwich.. fuck you! | Little too much cheese. 

And I love cheese, don’t get me wrong. | Just cut the amount of cheese on top and it probably increases the appeal instantly | Also doesn’t look like mozz tbh"

Rate my restaurant list,"Dear New Yorkers,

I am finally returning to the city that I was born in after almost 10 years in about a month. As it so happens I will also be celebrating my 30th birthday there. 
I will be traveling from Italy with my girlfriend and both my parents. Food being very important to us we obviously wanted to savor as much as possible of what NYC has to offer. 

I was researching a lot online over the past week(s) and now I think that I got all my restaurants down that we wanna visit. But since I dont know anyone from NYC personally I was hoping that you guys could help me out and give an opinion on the restaurants I have chosen. 

Just a quick rundown of what kind of restaurants we are looking for. I was looking for places that tend to be on the more celebratory side with good vibes, background music etc. food wise we wanted a mix of different asian cuisines, classic american, italian/american… as long as it is good! Also being from Italy we might tend to eat dinner a little later than the average here (around 8:30-9pm) so I was looking for places that will be full also at a later hour. 

So here are my final choices! Please give your honest opinion(and maybe an alternative if you dont agree)! 
 - Bangkok Supper Club (Tuesday evening)
 - San Sabino (Thursday evening)
 - Monkey Bar (Friday evening)
 - Estela (Saturday evening , birthday   dinner)
 - her name is han (lunch)
 - peter lugers (lunch) 

Also I know that for some of these restaurants its quite hard to get a reservation, also if you are on resy exactly when they release them so i was thinking of either contacting my concierge of my credit card or at the hotel that we are staying at (The Hotel Chelsea). 

Thank you for bearing with this long ass post and for helping a fellow (but clueless) new yorker out 🙏! Appreciate it a lot and cant wait to be back in December!  ","Her name is Han has mediocre Korean food. It’s less traditional and more of a modern take on it. If you want to go in to snap a few pretty pictures or take a date, it’s the place to go but taste wise it’s just okay. | Okay good to know! Do you have any suggestions? I was checking out Kisa as well, but unfortunately they are closed for lunch | If you want that home cook traditional Korean food Cho Dang Gol is pretty good and Tofu tofu is another I like without the wait. There are many that are better in Queens, but it’s an annoying trip to get up there. | Yea we are only staying for a couple of days so I dont know if we’d make it all the way to Queens, but thanks a lot:)!"
Need Some Suggestions ,"Coming in for a day bus trip in early December and need some suggestions for a few types of food between Battery and Central Parks.

Best fried whole belly clams? I am not very knowledgeable about NY seafood spots,Any neighborhood works but manhattan and north brooklyn are ideal for me.,"I’m a transplanted New England girl and in 23+ years I have never had a decent fried clam in NYC. Long Island, maybe. | Randazzo's Clam Bar in south Brooklyn | This same question came up a little over a month ago.. sadly there were only  two answers: oyster bar and bigelow’s in Rockville Centre | Just train up here to the North Shore in MA! lol 
I’ll take you to the best of the best. Choate Pub, Park Lunch, The Clam Box, Essex Seafood. | Johnny’s in city island. It’s a hike, but it’s the closest to a New England picnic tables on the water place we’ve got here, and the seafood is generally good. Next best option I know of would be Maine. | I think the Oyster Bar in Grand Central has them, but I have not had them there.

If you go, I really like their She Crab Soup. | Grand Central Oyster Bar has fried whole Ipswich clams at $39.99. | Used to have little neck in gowanus that would be enough to satiate (albeit NE is always better) but they just got booted from their spot a few months ago. Sad face. | Fried whole belly clams is one of things I enjoy when I go to the Cape Cod area. Not in NYC. | 😂😂 the only place I’ve had them was in White Castle. Mostly breading but it was good. | I think I asked this question a few years ago. Sadly, the song remains the same | I've never had fried soft shell clams on LI, only steamers. | Went once and had a really disappointing meal. Have had much better fried food on city island. | Bigelows is solid. Can also try Butler Flats in Port Washington (but it's not near the LIRR if that's how you go). | That's the real tip in this page. | New York good, but not New England good | What is the She Crab Soup like? I’ve never heard of this dish. Also been meaning to eat at this place forever so I guess this is my cue. | $39.99!!! Are they worth that much? | She-crab soup is a sort of crab bisque that originates from South Carolina. It's very good, I've never had it in NYC though | They’re hard to procure in NYC, I guess, or not very popular.  I’ve had fried clams in Boston and Maine.  The price is always high but $40 is a lot.  Same price as a lobster roll in fancy places. | i mean, you could drive out to Long Island or head up to the Cape. | https://www.oysterbarny.com/"

"Seven Grams, or Culture?",Toss up for me. The biscoff from SG is pretty insane though…,"Culture all the way for me. The crispy outside is particularly nice with the gooey inside. | Culture | Culture every day | another vote for Culture | Never heard of these places. Which did you like? | Depends on what you're getting tbh. 7 Grams offers a few flavors that Culture doesn't (Biscof and matcha off the top of my head).

But chocolate chip cookies? Culture hands down | Culture | I had the chocolate chip from 7 Grams and it was too goopy. I never thought a cookie could be too goopy, but it was. 

I haven’t tried Culture. | Culture is my fav but will have to give seven grams a try | 7 grams vegan is better than the regular and it’s better than culture | Culture always! | I love that 7 grams has vegan options | Seems like we all ought to try them both and report back. You know, for posterity. And science. | the culture one looks a little different that it normally does…but culture all the way | Culture but I like the cranberry oatmeal | Culture. From Lucy is my favorite though. 

Also has anyone noticed that Culture Espresso is inconsistent?

I’ve been on a cookie tour and made sure to try Culture Espresso multiple times, across their three locations and multiple visits. There are times when their chocolate chip cookie would wow me and others where it was pretty meh where it wouldn’t even place in the top of my rankings. I consistently came in the morning to make sure they were fresh, usually within the first hour of opening. A little sad, but my first visit was probably the best I’ve had them and it’s since never been replicated. | I like both - 7 grams is close to my work and I’ve sampled more of its magic … I’m biased | Adding biscoff is overdoing the job | Haven’t had culture in a while but 7 grams overrated | 7 grams was a joke. 6.50 for a smallish room temp middle tier cookie | If you like a crispy cookie but still gooey/chewy, Pastry Box's chocolate chip cookie is great too!
The kitchen sink cookie is amazing also if you're into a mix of textures. | ANOTHER GAME FOR MILOS | They’re both top of my list. Can’t go wrong with chocolate chip but I’d go with biscoff from Seven Grams and peanut butter from Culture | Culture has vegan options as well! Their vegan chocolate chip cookie is phenomenal, though unfortunately often sold out. | Because it’s the gf peanut butter chocolate chip"

Veselka,"I was told Veselka fell off post-pandemic but did not expect it to be this bad. I randomly popped in for lunch recently, craving the comfort of food from my younger days as a NYer and was sadly disappointed.

The staff are nice and the interior still has that nostalgic hint of “remember when you stumbled in here at 4 a.m. after a show at the Wetlands” but the food…

I got the stuffed cabbage and it might as well have been dumped from a red box that says Stouffers on it. Mushy, room temperature, and practically no texture on the cabbage aside from “this is the part that was touching the dish while in the microwave so it’s burnt a little”. The taste was—I don’t know. I got some of the peppery meat but the tomato sauce was as if someone simply grabbed a tomato from the shelf and squeezed as hard as they can over the dish before sprinkling some chopped parsley on top. I’m thankful I didn’t go with the mushroom gravy. Lord knows what sort of viscous puddle of goo would’ve blanketed my cabbage wrapped military gruel. My side dish was the beet salad with horseradish, which I am 1000% positive is now pre-made, jarred, and shoveled out when needed, as opposed to the freshly made, sharply crisp stuff I recall from years ago. 

I get it. Veselka built their brand and expanded but it seems to have come at an extreme expense of the quality of food. Even Shake Shack didn’t nosedive like this when they expanded. I’m now asking what the allure of Veselka is. Do tourists like it? NYU kids? East Village bros and basics? I have no idea and no longer care. 

Someone sat next to me while I ate and simply ordered eggs and a potato pancake. Back in the day I woulda thought that guy is seriously missing out one some primo city food. Today, though? I was envious I didn’t get the same thing.","Go to Ukranian National Home’s restaurant or Little Poland instead. | +1 for Wetlands reference!! | My Ukrainian wife calls it the Ukrainian Applebee’s and I think that stands up. Huge menu, good amount of mid food, some straight bad, and some gems. The appeal is the location, the history, and Eastern European food | Go next door and you’ll be happy again. | If you find yourself in Greenpoint, I highly recommend  Christina's and Karzma. They're Polish restaurants but have similar dishes. They have the best stuffed cabbage and good lunch deals during the week.

I went to Veselka years ago, I can't remember if it was pre or post pandemic, but I wasn't the biggest fan of their pierogies. | My 7 year old loves it. I think it’s nostalgia, it’s one of the first restaurants I started taking him too pre-covid. All we get are periogies though. And egg creams. The milkshakes are decent and they’re HUGE. I think the frozen pierogies from wegmans are about as good and a whole bag is cheaper than one order. But even before Covid, it was mediocre at best. The Ukrainian specialties were acceptable. Everything else was super greasy diner food at high prices. | I tried veselka for the first time maybe 4 years ago and it was pretty mid then for normal food, I don’t think it’s anything recent. Pierogis were pretty meh. Their soups were good though, they do matzoh ball and borscht | I always just get potato pancakes and they’ve always been great. I have their documentary in my queue. | Maybe it’s just me but when i used to go there as a teenager (the 90s) it was bc it was open 24 hrs and we were hanging out in the east village. Eating borscht or pirogies was a bonus.  Never thought the food was great.  Different but not great

That being said. The borscht is still pretty good and the mushroom barley is really good. | Was just there recently, I thought it still held up, those short rib pierogis still taste just as good as they did before. | I’m still sad from when they switched from serving half-n-half in little steel creamers on the table to plastic creamer packets. That was probably 20 years ago. 😂😂😂 | Never rated Veselka more than a meh... even meh on drunken early mornings. Never understood what the fuss was about. | R.I.P. Teresa’s in Brooklyn Heights was the best | I haven’t been there in a year or so, but I grew up walking distance from veselka and used to go all the time. I always thought it was fine, but it wasn’t particularly good in my opinion. It was an interesting option for late night food and it was open 24 hours. Was there something you had there in the past that you thought was really good in particular? | I really miss Wetlands. | Hot take, Veselka has never had great food, it was beloved because it never closed  not because it’s a dining destination | When it’s 4am and your drunk mid food is fire, but that same stuff in the daytime is trash. Shocking | People like the atmosphere! I agree about the food.  For good food without atmosphere, go to Streecha | I went to Veselka for the first and last time before the pandemic. The food had a produce sticker label in it and we brought it to the attention of the staff. The manager came over completely unfazed and argued with me saying it’s a non-issue. Never went back after that. | Veselka fell off in after that renovation in the very late 90' - 00's. I literally lived across the street back then. When the new place opened up and they changed from that thick, hearty challah bread to that dainty, thin bs I knew it was over. Kiev hung around a little bit longer, but when that died it was the end of an era for me for sure | It was never good. Its just 24hrs and next to st marks | This makes me sad 😔 Veselka was one of the first places I ever ate at in the East village as a tourist back in the early 90s, and I always had a soft spot for it as a “treat yo self” meal (because when I was a broke 22 year old the 3 course vegetarian menu was a splurge). But  haven’t been in probably 10-12 years. Aaaand now I probably won’t go back. Blah. | Eh the food kind of sucked already 15 years ago, it was just a good late night snack due to being fun. | The new Williamsburg location sucks too | Has anyone watched the documentary yet? | I totally agree with you, the last time I went to Veselka, my food and appetizers were served all together, as if they were in a rush, it didn't take 15 minutes for my food to arrive and I wonder HOW!?, I couldn't enjoy my appetizer and then my main dish, they didn't offer me any refills or the dessert menu when I finished eating, the waitress literally cleaned my table and gave me the check. I'm a sucker.. or used to be for their honey cake and I can guarantee it doesn't taste the same anymore, sad. | Have you ever had their carrot cake? Super slept on lol | Oh I loved it 25 years ago. Not so much when I took my daughter there last year. | I was dropping off my daughter nearby yesterday (Sunday) and line was halfway around the block both at noon and when I picked her up at 1:30 | Unfortunately it's true. Before it was overpriced and nostalgic, and now it's just overpriced and mediocre. | So sad, I agree. It used to be really good and hasn’t been the same post-Covid. Idk… maybe the experienced cooks left? I would love to go often bc I do think the staff is amazing and so kind but the food has gotten so bad 😣 I don’t even know what to order anymore. 

I also really miss Stage Restaurant which used to be around the corner… they had the best borscht 😭 | And their prices aren't cheap too. I get it, inflation, but $25 for egg benny? And when they stopped making sutya I knew they are going commercial | They've fallen off well before covid. The last time I was there was 6 or 7 years ago? The stuffed cabbage I got was warm on the outside and stone cold in the center! I did get the mushroom gravy and it was bland and unremarkable. I always crave their pumpkin pierogis in the fall but was told they took it off the menu. They may have added them back by popular demand? The ones I wound up getting were meh mid nothing special. It was a complete throwaway meal that was a letdown. I agree, it used to be a great place 25-30 years ago when it was just a low key neighborhood spot for un-fancy comfort food and coffee. | It was terrible the last 2 times I ate there. | Huge support. Just bad borscht. I go to karczma instead. Stricha closed, but supposedly it's back | Tried it for the first time last winter. Not a fan of the stuffed cabbage and the pierogis were average, but the borscht was fantastic | Did you also accidentally end up spending like $150? | I walked by the other day and it was still packed out the ass. one thing I did notice though is a lot of the cooks looked pretty young. wonder if the new generation just isn't as good at making that rustic ukrainian cuisine | veselka pierogis and american breakfast are fire. i don’t get anything else from there | It fell off decades ago when they remodeled and doubled their prices. I've probably been there three times since. | Used to love their vegetarian stuffed cabbage. Anyone have a rec for another spot that has a good one? | Shake Shack barely nose dived in quality... maybe in value though. | Not sure I can trust a Vaselka review from someone who didn’t get the pierogies. But if true, this is very sad indeed. | Went there recently and very disappointed in the stuffed cabbage. Pierogi we’re ok. | I was terribly underwhelmed by the Williamsburg location. I was so bummed. | Personally I hate cabbage and beets, so can't relate to your order. 

But as others mentioned, the potato pancakes are pretty much a requirement every time I go with family. Almost always get the pierogi too - and I'm a fan of their beef goulash. 

Overall I'm never ""blown away"" but I feel like they are consistent with the specific few dishes I enjoy. | It’s not their fault you grew up | Why on God's green earth would you spend 20 minutes on a personal creative writing project trashing a NYC institution? No one cares if you don't like it. Good grief. You should do some soul searching on this one. | why even step foot in there? And then make this post? Not even sure why its still running | Veselka is terrible. It's also about three generations removed from Ukrainian food. It's a trash restaurant. | Is this the place that used to be like only open on Sundays or just the weekend like 8-10 years ago? And if you didn’t get there within a couple hours they would be sold out?

If it is, their stuff cabbage was amazing and shame it went downhill. | Love little Poland! | Little Poland is excellent. Tried the Williamsburg Veselka after not visiting the Manhattan location in about ten years, and was very disappointed. | This is the answer. | Where is little Poland? | So wonderful to see the wetlands reference!   Although I went to the Kiev/Veselka more often after the 4am shows at Nightingale which was a few blocks away.  Wetlands was far enough away that I usually just went home afterwards. | Real ones know! | Wetlands was the jam band club?  Remember the name but trying to place it. | Yeah. Simpler times! | It’s really not even that big of a menu. | What are the gems? Because I was quite disappointed by their pierogi | Wait a second pause, you were on to something but this needs correction. It is no longer about the food my dude. The food sucks now lets be real, that is the whole point of the post. Cant sneak that in there lol | What’s next door? | Right and real New Yorkers know this and still love it bc there's room for everything in that city. This chick doesn't get it at all. We don't need you to post a scathing review of a diner lmao ffs the nerve. How self-important. Get a hobby. | i'd say it went downhill post pandemic. no idea why. but i always remember enjoying it before covid. | Seriously the food is always good when I go I don't know what OP is on about | I love both of their soups. My ideal order there is literally a bowl of borscht followed by a bowl of mushroom barley | It was a late night sit down spot for when you felt like something a little different from the usual late night grub.   

It never occured to me to visit when sober. | Loved it!! | It was loved because there aren’t a lot of places with that food. But it never tasted like the real thing.. just bad quality. | I wasn't only going at 4 a.m. back then. | Fr. This post blows. What an ass. Here lemme trash this historical institution for attention from strangers on the internet. Taf. This new content culture generation of NYC is the worst and has totally ruined the vibe of the city overall IMO, dining especially. Look at this cookie! Omg cronuts! I'm so glad I got out of there before this took over. Everyone in NYC knows what's good and what's not. People still talk to each other, you know? This post is as useless as it is pathetic. Not every single feeling you have needs to be an internet announcement. 🤮 | Shhhhh we aren't supposed to tell people about Streecha | Na, it was good. | I found a hair in my order from that location :( | It’s SO BAD | My Baba’s recipe. | Did you just discover the internet? | No that was streecha, best stuffed cabbage I’ve ever had, unfortunately they closed :/ | I thought Little Poland tasted like reheated cafeteria food compared to the Polish spots in Greenpoint.  | Polka Dot in Greenpoint (Polish here.  Highly recommend) | 2nd Ave | Kiev had the best soup . Period . | Real old ones know! | I was 13 when I went to my first show there and I'm still traumatized by the anti-fur pamphlets of skinned animals that were laying around

Also the bathroom.. | I feel old now :) | I used to go see punk shows there all the time. It was a pretty diverse venue from what I remember. Been meaning to watch this documentary but just haven't gotten to it - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ScLy7iC264](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ScLy7iC264) | Hudson and Hubert, Tribeca. | Grateful Dead cover band on Tuesdays, otherwise it ranged from jam bands to hardcore punk, death metal, lots of funk, reggae, etc. Basically any genre outside the mainstream at the time. 

Owner opened Brooklyn Bowl when Wetlands closed. | Get the borscht. | I thought the schnitzel was solid but nothing to run home about | It’s about it being an accessible Eastern European spot for a lot of people who have little exposure to things like borscht, schnitzel, pierogi, etc. it’s right in NYU country too, so it exposes a lot of people to this type of food. Wasn’t a quality comment just a variety | Ukrainian house | Yeah it was way better before. Sad | Wait, are you bashing cronuts? Don’t fight hate with hate, those things are good as well. | Exactly. All the knowledgeable diners are posting rave reviews of Veselka, so all the tourists will go there instead of [insert your secret spot].

There is another Reddit thread that talked about a London chain steak house called Angus Steak.  A lot of locals wrote rave reviews about Angus Steak to fool tourists so their regular spots won’t be overrun by tourists.

Will share the link if I find it
https://www.reddit.com/r/london/s/HndWDI9r3F | No it wasn’t. You were just young, drunk and very hungry and excited to be hanging out late night with friends. Did you ever go for lunch back then? | Agreed. I got chicken paprikash and it tasted like nothing. Nothing! The enormous mound of egg noodles tasted better. I was so mad I paid nearly $30 | Look I think it's one thing if you want to do an online crucification of some $400/pp nouveau molecular gastronomy restaurant that isn't really part of New York's cultural history, go ahead... but leave the old institutions alone. There's obviously something besides just their food keeping them around. If enough people stop going, they'll close... New York rent is expensive enough that the trash takes itself out, and pretty quickly. I'm not sure why you'd find it enjoyable to conduct a one man internet crusade against an old neighborhood staple. Like who is this helping? | Ah damn! Granted I hadn’t been there in years but made a point to stop there when the timing was right. | We love Polka Dot! (Hungarian here lol) | Polka Dot is amazing, nice and legit | Karczma is also solid. | Loved the white borscht | Bathroom was awesome! Complete with Tim Vega mural and soundboard feed. | I saw Robbie Krieger there. Also, George Clinton. It’s now condos. Hey, Manhattan. | 161 Hudson street, three blocks south of canal.  The address is burnt into my memory. | don't forget to add sour cream to it. | how hard is it to fuck up a schnitzel though | Dude, yes. I've lived in this city for over 40 years. I've gone to Veselka at various points in my life. I don't go as often simply for dietary reasons.  Believe it or not, there  was a time when Eastern European food dominated the EV. Aside from Veselka, there was the Kiev, Little Poland, the recently closed Odessa, 2nd Ave deli was down there, and many others I can't think of right now. They all made excellent food emblematic of their origin. Why are you so intent on dictating what my life's experience was? | They have such fantastic goodies around Easter; their Easter sausage in particular is fantastic | The chicken noodle, split pea , potato pickle were all excellent | Most Ukis don’t put sour cream in borscht.  Not necessary and my mom wouldn’t allow it, frankly.  The old man didn’t do it either.  Veselka has always been a bit more Russified though. | Don't forget Teresa's which was always my fave | I’m not intent on it. If you say you think the food was awesome and you ate there frequently sober then I believe you. I feel like many people only went there late night and drunk. | And Neptune. I miss Neptune. It wasn’t great- but it had its gems. | I agree. I have a number of freinds who are easter european jews who said their parents perogies were 100% better and I agreee with them. Little poland and the place downstairs always had better, less expensive food."

"What restaurants in NYC deserve the ""Eisenberg's"" treatment (i.e., don't change the food, but bring everything else into the 21st century)?","The other day, I was marveling at how lucky we are to have S&P when it just as easily could have become other soulless fast casual nightmare. Wondering what other restaurants could use a change or two from a light touch.","Cozy Soup & Burger. 

It's a decent diner, but I'm sure it's hasn't changed much in decades. | havent been but i saw online they did something similar to kelloggs diner. i think a lot of diners could use a revamp. especially if therye already charging high prices, why not make it good | Bolivian Llama Project is perfect, but ever since they took down their outdoor seating, it really shows how much perfecter it would be for them to move into a space with in-person dining. | many of the hole in the wall bagel places with quality bagels but inconsistent sandwiches and filthy floors | not a restaurant per se, but some of favorite bagel places could use a step towards the future. i understand part of the charm is that bagel places are “old school” institutions of the neighborhood, but not having tap to pay or modern POS systems can really slow down the process & make lines longer | The owners of S&P improved pretty much all of the food that Eisenberg’s used to make. Not sure why you think the food was unchanged. If anything, the thing untouched are the counter and the tables. | Grand Central Oyster Bar | Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda | Veselka | I want to say B&H but I love that little dump too much. | I think Kellogg’s Diner and Montague Diner are two that did it right (alongside S&P of course which I love)

I would really love some of the other iconic diners in the city to get a revamp, like Court Sq Diner or Tick Tock Diner. 

Besides that, I really think that something like Old Homestead could get the fated “restaurant group makeover” treatment | Spot on! Had S&P again today. Always a delight. | Soup Burg | S&P rules  | 0 uoo | Parc in Philadelphia. | Kellog's is kinda the opposite of this, the food was changed *radically* to bring it up to date. | Haha -- I went to Kellogg's last night, and it's what made me think of the question! | This doesn’t apply to Kellogg’s at all as they are a now a Tex mex brunch spot with very little of the true diner food that they used to have. It is far from “a light touch” | Kellogg’s prices aren’t bad now, honestly. 

I went with 3 friends recently. We got 2 big appetizers that we shared, 2 cocktails, 4 entrees, and one dessert. The total before tip was $160. 

And the food was pretty damn good! | With the outdoor seating no longer there, are they now takeout only then? | I lived in Sunnyside and love their saltanas but they are so out of the way, no seating, and not as enjoyable walking 10+ mins to my apt. They should have taken advantage of the instagram hype and moved to a better serving spot. They definitely need a spot on Queens Blvd even if its a small shop with limited seats. | wait, when did the outdoor seating come down?!? I was there last month (I think) and it was still up. | They serve Llama? I’m more of an alpaca fan myself… | Specifically bagel hole. I would clean that place for free for them if they let me lol | What would you change? | Nah don’t touch it. The interiors are all perfect. Just fix the smell. | Their food sucks… keep everything else the same and change the food. | Except veselka should probably make the food better. It's so mid. | I adore their stuffed cabbage and mushroom barley soup, but a lot of items on the menu could use improvement.

(Where are y’all going to satisfy Ukrainian cravings if not Veselka?) | That place is just not good.  | https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gugis8/veselka/ | the ave they're on is also a (lesser) commercial corridor and IMHO is way more enjoyable to get food on than a massive noisy blvd | Not sure but I was there two weekends ago and the shelter was gone | Literally the one I was thinking of | Very little! Just freshen up the space a bit, tighten the menu, make sure the quality is there. As OP said, give it the Eisenberg's Treatment. | smell?  please elaborate | Agreed. Veselka needs to either lower their prices or raise the quality, cause right now it's absurdly overpriced for mid basic Ukrainian diner food. | Next door. | I think that the deadline for taking down the sheds just passed. Nov 1 maybe? Some restaurants applied for permits to keep the dining sheds but even those have to be removed seasonally. The deadline for the seasonal removal is November 29. So anyone that has the shed up still will only have to for a few weeks at most till spring, if they plan to bring it back at all. | I love this idea. | You know, the near overpowering smell of bleach and fish. | it's crazy to me how there's long lines for Veselka when there's a better priced, not busy place next door | I walked by there this week and looked at the menu for the first time in a few years and was shocked how much their prices and have gone up. I’m glad they are still around (I spent many a night there in my late teens / early twenties many a year ago) but wow. | Shame on me for not trying them sooner. What are the can’t-miss things to try? | Eh, to me its kind of like the difference between Chinese takeout and a fancier, traditional sichuan restaurant. The american-ized stuff is for american palettes, and the traditional stuff is for people who want to experience culture/nationals.

Ive been to the ukrainian national home restaurant with my ukrainian family. It was good, hearty, more traditional food; and there was not a single smile among any if the FoH staff. My dad was floored, said it was almost like he was back at his aunts house. But theyre not cooking up bbq short rib pierogies there! | I like getting their combo plates with a friend and starting with borscht. Perfect amount to get  stuffed and be happy with your wallet."
Looking for the best bars with weird/unique/good cocktails,Looking for cocktail bars that have unique menus — like they are making drinks like noone else. ,"Mace by a mile. The back room of Double Chicken is also great, but is a harder reservation and the drinks are a hair worse. 

Honorable mention goes to Amar y Amargo - their cocktails aren’t creative in terms of ingredients, but their whole program is built around spirit forward bitters. | Uniqueness is an interesting thing to select for among cocktail bars, because a lot of them are setting themselves apart in execution, but not necessarily flavor palate. Even among the true high end bar scene, there isn't much departure from standard templates in terms of drink composition.

Double Chicken is the obvious standout from a pure uniqueness perspective. Martiny's and Shinji's have some pretty unique offerings as well and all 3 of those hail from the Angel's Share family tree. Sugar Monk and Bitter Monk are unique in that they actually use a farmer's license instead of a liquor license, so all their ingredients have to be from within the tri state area, so they make a bunch of stuff in house that you can't find anywhere else, lots of local herbs and grasses on display in a super cool enviornment (highly recommend the trek to Bitter Monk so you can be in their actual lab where they're distilling this stuff). 

I'm personally not a huge fan, but Sip at Sip&Guzzle has stuff that you simply will not find elsewhere, they have a pretty unique flavor palate for the US. Mace is kiiiinda in the same group since they're super focused on herbs and botanical, but they do stick much closer to standard templates than some of the other places here IMO. | Mr. Melo has a feta brine martini I’d like to try. Obviously you gotta like dirty martinis in general for that to sound appealing. Ra-Ra-Rhino has a Vegemite martini that’s… quite something; I can’t say I’d get it again, but it’s certainly unique (other cocktails were good tho)!

It’s a basic answer, but I think The Dead Rabbit still has the best cocktails in the city. | Mace | The Little Shop is the first one that comes to my mind. | Otto's | Angel’s Share | I love leyenda. But not sure if that “unique” enough | Double Chicken Please | I still haven't made it to Bar Contra, but anywhere helmed by Dave Arnold will definitely qualify. | I recently went to Lolita on 45th and had the pico de gallo martini. It was a very unique savory cocktail. It came with a single chip with “pico de gallo caviar” on it. They have an extensive cocktail list and the bar is large and pretty | Jac’s on Bond! Had an amazing Caprese Martini and easy to get a rez | Chinato | - Apotheke Chinatown
- Mace
- the hidden pearl
- NR
- sama street | AyA is very traditional in a way that makes them sort of unique nowadays. No juice, and no shaking is a really interesting constraint to build a modern bar program around. | Mace is definitely unique but I was disappointed. Unique doesn’t = good. | I agree that Mace and DCP are great, but when you say the ingredients at Amor y Amargo \*aren't\* creative you mean that they're all alcohol, right? Because in any given drink they use at least two ingredients I've never heard of before. | Interesting- I find Mace bland and tasteless- I don’t get the hype. (I do love amor y amargo- they are never less than excellent) | Great cocktails and you can pop over to Clover Club too"
Best places to eat alone (counter),"Good morning everyone. I travel no Nyc about a month, alone, and I’m looking for good places to eat, with preference seated on the counter with a good beer. Any recommendations? Thank you. ","This is actually a non issue in the city. It’s absolutely normal and expected to go to any restaurant cheap or $$$$ and sit alone at the bar or even a table. We all do it here and it’s expected. Enjoy | No ones mentioned that if you dine alone at Minetta (or any other Keith McNally restaurant) they comp you one glass of champagne! | Eisenberg sandwiches for lunch! I love the counter experience | Grand Central Oyster Bar | Pretty much anywhere! Two of my favorites are minetta and raouls because I love a burger and a dirty martini. But nearly anywhere that has a bar will be happy to have you pop in and post up. Solo dining is how I’ve managed to have some of my best meals in New York. | Raoul's | Anywhere really, 
Solo-dining is your best option to get walk-ins so just go to places you fancy and try your luck (worst comes to worst you’re on your own and can just change „plans“) 

If you’re really into privacy: 
- ichiran cabins (obviously)
- gyu kaku has solo stoves 
- Jin ramen  

Bar spots that you should consider: 
- dame   
- minetta tavern  
- gramercy  
- veselka | A couple of years ago I went to Stockholm solo and sat down at the bar in a restaurant to eat. The bartender came up to me, smiled, and said, ""you must be American.""  I asked how he knew, and he said ""Americans love eating at the bar."" It's true! You'll be fine wherever. | Ate at the counter at the S&P today. Love that spot. It’s a can’t miss for me when I’m in the city. | Echoing Minetta Tavern | JG Melon is great for sitting at the counter; I much prefer this to getting a table there. About half of people at the bar will be alone. | You could try the actual counter at Hamburger America (they serve High Life) | I like Pig and Khao's counter seats. There's a small counter (\~5 seats) [that directly faces the kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4yPPiK2iZCGsakGL7) and you can watch the chefs make the food. | Lil Frankie’s | Absolutely any restaurant you walk into will be able to offer this experience. IMHO, it’s the best way to dine in NYC:) | Go to franks the just fit everyone in | NYC is made for eating at the bar alone. I like Odeon (TriBeCa) . I bring my AirPods & listen to podcast . | Thank you all for you sugestions. Any recommendation near the WTC? | Get the burger at Raoul’s. | Oyster bar grand central number one 

Sarges deli | Udon St. Marks! | Bubby’s for breakfast! You can pretty much skip the crazy lines if you want the counter solo. | Balthazar is nice. | The Jeffrey on East 60th has a great beer program | Kazunori! Fav solo spot - always so quick & delicious. | Blind Tiger has great beer, food & people | Kazu nori | Any sushi bar or bar period works | You can eat anywhere alone in NYC and no one will think twice about it!

If you want a rec, Thai Diner has a nice bar/counter area where you can eat and drink solo and their food is bangin’ 😃 | Kazunori | Raku! | Thai Diner on Mott st | Fried Chicken and a beer at Commodore. | If you like free hot dogs and $3 beers go to Rudy’s in Hell’s Kitchen. They’re supposedly all beef dogs as well. 

If you want, in my opinion the best slice in nyc, get the boss’ favorite slice at cello’s pizzeria in st marks place (and they’re only about $4 too). 

If you’re short on cash and see a “two bros pizza” you could do far worse than $1.50 for a cheese slice that tastes as good as a $3 slice. 

Le relais de Venise l’entrecôte is a pre fix menu slightly upscale restaurant with delicious 2 portion steak and fries dinner with a unique sauce. It also comes with bread and salad. Oddly enough, the vegetarian option is a pretty good deal as well. You don’t get steak, but you get two salads, a small cheese plate, and one of their fantastic desserts. | Estela | Cocoron for delicious soba noodle dishes! The bar seats are very cozy | I Sodi has some of the best bar seating for 1. Great wines and delicious pasta + fun people watching | HAMBURGER AMERICA. | JG Mellon | Awesome! That is great. Sometimes I feel weird because on my country (Portugal), that is not very commom. | Yep. So the answer is any restaurant bar seats and beer! | Minetta is actually the worst place to dine alone. They basically shamed me for assuming they would have a walk in seat available. 

  
Full bar was open and they sat me in the corner and then ruined my meal with a undercooked burger and week old stale bun. | Me too! It’s actually called S&P Lunch now (so OP can find it more easily) | Came here to say this too. | Came here to say this. Love sitting there and having a beer or martini with oysters and listening to all the conversations. | Did it Friday and they had one stool open as I walked in. Sat immediately | Love JG Melon! | Came here to say this, esp w a cold beer, classic NYC vibe | +1 this was my recommendation | The Dead Rabbit | Temple Court

Fraunces Tavern | I second dead rabbit. There are loads of spots in that area, most are meh but Delmonicos can be fun and good. 

Also — the tin building (on the East River but walking distance from WTC) has great spots to sit for a drink and snack and Red Pearl (Chinese in the tin building) has a lovely bar and I liked the food the last time I was there.

I love the bar at the Perlman performing arts center. | Manhatta | Harry’s or Chambers. Both about 10 minutes from WTC in different directions. Harry’s is classic NyC style steak house with a thriving bar area and many beers on tap — including a great Guinness. Chambers is upscale modern American with Scandinavian influence and an amazing wine list. | It’s actually great eating alone at the bar you can get into a lot of the impossible to book places. For example (I live in NOHO) I’ve eaten at Via Carrota, Una Pizza Neapolitana, Penny, Rubirosa and Il Buco recently (they all have really vibey counters and there’s generally another single diner or two there if you want to chat) with no wait or a short wait as a walk in. | Same ~ just getting lost in the noise around you dining solo in nyc at a bar"

You can find some of their other must-tries [here](https://dishr.sefino.co/share?url=BCx1tA14eTchPz6MA&ref=r1). | As is, they're delicious, but I really want Ramirez to make tortillas to order. It would put their them on another level. | They should fix their listings in Brooklyn to list Brooklyn as the city, not New York. | can confirm the Frena bread goes incredibly hard | Subing to this | Will have to check some of these out! | Agreed definitively a good starting point for people to see what’s good. | Agreed. No list is ever going to be ""perfect"" and there's always going to be some omissions, questionable inclusions, etc. but this is actually a pretty compelling list of interesting names and options. And it's not perfectly spread out but it has a good enough spread to make me think they're at least *trying*. | Infatuation is really solid imo, their Houston team throws out some odd disses occasionally but most importantly their raves have never been wrong. It's become my go-to restaurant review site | Basically every dish I can't afford right now | The muhammara was so so good. A spectacular meal overall | Got no time as they tend to the swines ;) | Same with queens"
Who makes the best bialy in NYC?,"It's definitely not Kossars in my book. I just ordered some from Orwashers on the UES and was very impressed. The center had just the right amount of onions. Taste and texture was just right. Just to the bialy fans and I think we're fewer in number each year, who do you think makes the best bialy","Orwashers | Yep, you found them | I think I've mostly bought them from Jacks in the early 2000s. I know where orwashers is. They have a factory near me. | Only eat them from Barney Greengrass once they’re dressed up with lox etc., but they’re always delicious | Rollen in Riverdale, and it’s not close.  By far the best Bialy in the city and worth the trip | AR Hot Bagels in Red Hook has a great bialy. Made fresh each morning and usually sold out early. their bagels are pretty bad as a warning | Kossars | Zabar’s sells Bell brand. 

Does Orwasher’s make it in house?
There was a time they sold a corn rye with seeds that would make you cry it was so good. Found it was made by the old Moshe’s Bakery.

Just a farmer's market stand for now. Miso scallion and garlic naan bialies! https://www.instagram.com/bageljointny/ | Elbow Room bakery in the old MEL location, in Dimes Square, has a very good bialy. | Jacks had the best!  But I don’t think they sell them anymore | It sucks how they got rid of the $1.29 kosher style breads there such as sesame rings, challah, and so forth. They still have fancy cheese sometimes though. They've been reduced to a single times square location. | When they first stopped stocking the bialy’s I spoke to a manager and they said it’s because of the bakery no longer supplying them. I wonder if it’s the same with the rest of the breads from the same bakery? Didn’t realize jacks by herald square is gone! That one was my go to. | Yes, the bakery that makes them, which I think is in Brooklyn, is no longer around I believe. It's depressing that closeout stores are going away."
Looking for a good bo ssam spot for a solo lunch,"As the title suggests, hoping to find a restaurant that serves good bo ssam and preferably a portion size for one.

Allergy Friendly Restaurants ,"My family is taking a trip to Manhattan mainly UES and midtown. I was wondering if anyone knew any restaurants that are allergy friendly? My siblings have dairy, gluten, fish, nuts, soy, egg allergy plus a couple others. They constantly feel left out and I want my family to have a good meal that they can also enjoy. If anything they'll probably just bring food from home but I would like them to have the same experience we all have somewhere safe. We're are willing to travel a bit to get to the restaurant. If you have any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it! ","How much are you looking to spend?  A number of fine dining places will bend over backwards for you if you ask ahead of time.  I think talking to Family Meal would be worth it (and probably just ask them to apply those restrictions to all seats, so you all get the same shared food).

IIRC Friedmans can probably accommodate this? But again, check with them first.  They're explicitly known for GF, but I've heard they're pretty serious about allergies in general.

You could check with Vatan.  They're $45 ayce Indian thali restaurant with a number of restricted menus including vegan (it's all veg), GF, and nut free, so that just leaves soy. | -	Jajaja Mexicana has an [allergen guide](https://www.jajajamexicana.com/files/allergen-guide-pdf.pdf).
-	Jongro is Korean BBQ with a [menu](https://www.jongrobbqny.com/menu) that says what’s gluten free, contains shellfish, and is vegetarian."
Intimate/Private Dining for 2,"I’m eloping in NYC which has an amazing
food scene. We were originally going for a private dining room to seat twenty. We’ve pivoted to it solely being is two to avoid distractions and overspending. However I’m having a hard time finding a restaurant to fit our needs. 

Currently looking for a restaurant (or hotel suite) with a private/semi-private space for two. Preferably old world charm or a space with aesthetic character. In essence, we want to be able to bring a cake, floral decor from the ceremony, and photographer in as we eat our dinner. I do intend on “styling” the space for the sake of pictures with enough space for a “first dance”. Going for a romantic dinner for two feel. 

So far I’ve considered using The Ludlows loft suite (removing the couch and replacing with a table). The Chelsea has two small spaces. Public hotel has a nice versatile boardroom. As well as a beautiful dining space in La Marchande. 

Are there any other restaurants or hotels that offer intimate spaces or semi-private without a high minimum spend (typically for larger groups) that would allow this to be executed? ",
Three Nights in NYC for GF’s Birthday – Looking for Dining Recs,"
Greetings from Toronto. I’m heading to NYC for three nights in early December to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. We’re staying in NoMad but are willing to explore all over Manhattan for some great dining experiences.

Birthday Dinner: Looking for an intimate spot with that NYC vibe– somewhere romantic with great service. Open to any cuisine (except Korean, though Jua has caught my eye). Right now, I’m considering Clinton 63, Estela, or Minetta Tavern. Any thoughts on these? Or any other suggestions for a special night?

Italian Night: Hoping to book at Torrisi, Via Carota, L’Artusi, or San Sabino for one night, though I know reservations can be tough. Would love any other recs if those don’t work out!

Thanks so much in advance for any tips",

Best focaccia loaf in NYC,I am not looking for a slice I'm looking for a loaf.,
What is the best restaurant that can sit 10 people for the holidays?,"Just as the title says! To give more details, we’re planning a get together in December, a couple days before Christmas. 

In terms of location, we figured to avoid places between 14th to 60th street (Manhattan) because of the business that will definitely ensue. Preferably, upper manhattan as a huge chunk of us live that area or the Bronx.

For food, we do have people with a shellfish and nut allergy, as well a preference of vegan/vegetarian options. Budget is about $40.

I know it’s a lot to ask, but we are open to any suggestions. Thank you in advance!",

New Year’s Eve Eve bar,"Looking to send an invite to all my friends (to then send to friends of friends and whoever) an invite to bar for New Year’s Eve Eve this year.

Food gifts from NYC? ,I’m going to be visiting my boyfriend’s family for the first time this Thanksgiving in St. Louis - I want to bring them sort of special NYC food/ baked goods as a gift. Something that’s specific to NYC and that I can fly with. Thanks! ,"Chocolate babka | Bagels, wrap them really tightly to try to keep them fresh | I've seen someone tape 2 pizza boxes together, with a tape handle, and take it through airport security. 

TSA: ""What's this?""

Dude: ""Pizza carry on. I'm going to see my friends in Montana, and their pizza sucks""

TSA: ""Yeah that makes sense.""

  
No idea how legal that is/isn't, but that certainly is a power move to do a long distance delivery | I highly recommend a box of Levain cookies! | Black and White cookies or Rainbow cookies | - Babka from Breads or Michaeli
- Cookies from Culture Espresso
- pineapple buns and other baked goods from Tao Hong, Double Crispy, Tai Pan
- banh bo nuong, pandan coffee cake, and other Vietnamese American / French baked goods
- Janie's pie crust cookies
- Black and white cookies from William Greenberg or Orwashers

Best Italian Heros?,"I love hot Italian sandwiches: chicken parm, chicken pesto, meatball parm, basically anything parm or with sauce. With that said, I've tried many iconic places throughout the Nyc, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, but definitely not all of the classics. For reference, I've had hot Italian heros from:  
\- Lioni's in Brooklyn (chicken vodka parm, one of the best, ever)  
\- Mozzlab in Brooklyn (chicken parm, their fresh mozz is to die for)  
\- Royal Crown in Staten Island (chicken parm (with vodka also) their bread is off the chains)  
\- Parisi Bakery in East Village (chicken parm, I thought the sauce had too much oregano, but great bread)  
\- Faicco's in West Village (the bread was so good! I got the chicken pesto and chicken vodka parm, the vodka parm was lacking sauce imo, but the chicken pesto was one of the best I've had)  
\- Milano West Side Market in UES (tripe S(pesto, marinara, vodka), did not live up to the hype, overrated in my opinion)  
\- Denino's in Staten Island (yes, they have a Staten Island location lol. chicken parm, awesome sandwich anyday)  
Alright, that should help my creditability a little and give you a picture of what I like. Now, I have other places on my list to try, like:  
\- Defontes in Brooklyn  
\- B&A Pork Store in Brooklyn  
\- Supper in East Village  
\- Diso's Food Truck in the Financial District  
\- Pizza Loves Sauce in LES  
\- Carlo's Grocery in Brooklyn  
\- Mike's Deli in the Bronx  
Is there any place I am missing or need to try or add to my list? Any input is appreciated and helpful, cheers.

P.S.  I made this post also to help me keep track of places I've been and want to go.

[Sal, Kris, & Charlie's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sal-kris-and-charlies-deli-astoria)

[Rosario's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/rosarios-astoria-2) | Your list is good. Defonte’s is the GOAT.  Maybe add Fiore’s in Hoboken, and Charlie’s in Bay Ridge. 

(Paneantico in Bay Ridge is also good, but it’s the same owners as Crown Royal, so I think you wouldn’t be necessarily tasting anything new. Same incredible bread.) |  Pissilo | Tinos in Arthur Ave (Bronx). And FWIW the Milano Market on the west side (113 and Broadway) is way better than the UES location. Different owners too that apparently hate each other. Family feud of sorts. | Rosario’s in Astoria is legit! | Regina’s Grocery is way better than Milano Market on the UES | Peppinos in Park slope brooklyn serves up amazing meatball, chicken parm and grilled chicken caprese hero's on their homemade pizza dough bread! | Vinny’s in Carroll Gardens - shrimp parm hero | In the Bronx... [G and R](https://www.instagram.com/g_and_r_deli_/?hl=en) in Morris park has outstanding heros.

I honestly never get them from Mikes Deli but I love the sandwiches at [Calabrian pork store](https://calabriapork.com/) and Casa Mozzerella too.

  
In Bushwick .. Carmentas has some great sandwiches. | Instead of (or in addition to). Mikes Deli in that neighborhood try:

-Casa Della Mozzarella (my fav)
-Tino's
-Calabria Pork Store,
-Joes Deli

Also in The Bronx check out G+R over in Morris Park | fyi deninos originated in staten island. | I wouldn't say it's the best out of all the places already listed but [Mama's too](https://www.mamastoo.com/) is definitely worth a visit and should be added to your list. I think they have a select rotation of sandwiches but I vaguely remember it being on certain days only (wednesdays?) | anything at Mike's Deli in Arthur Aenue's Retail market, BRONX, that's real Italian! | John’s deli in Brooklyn. Roast beef sandwich is incredible | Bookmarked this.  Thanks for the list! | joe ave u , delfont on colombia street, john deli stillwell | Regina’s on mulberry street is really terrific …less known, but probably the OG of great Italian sandwich spots | Been meaning to try the Artichoke Parm at Mama Louisa’s | Alidoro | Lionis. List over. | John's Deli and Jimmy's Heroes in Southern Brooklyn | Milanos in Jersey City (steps from exchange place PATH so very convenient to NYC) is worth a trip. | Joe’s Deli in the Bronx | Great list here.

I’ll also add the chicken parm hero from L+B spumoni gardens | I know you said hot sandwiches, but I recently had an Italian cold cut sandwich from Leo's Latticini (AKA Mama's) in Corona and it was phenomenal. It's called the Mama Special. | donfilipporestaurant.com | City Subs, Park Slope Brooklyn

Their mortadella provolone is bangin | [Carmenta's](https://www.carmentasnyc.com/) in Bushwick, excellent parm sandwiches (fave is the meatball sub) | Paneantico in bay ridge | Meatball parm from rosarios | Also, not Italian but you should check out a TCS from cherry valley in Whitestone. I haven't been there in a few years but worth it if still the same. | Disos Italian sandwich society is a good list addition | MAMA’s in Corona Queens
Jimmy’s Famous Hero’s in Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn
John’s Deli in Gravesend Brooklyn 
BTW, Denino’s original location is the Staten Island one.
Defontes (Sloppy Nicks) is the GOAT
Fiores in Hoboken is also excellent |  Anthony & Son | Honestly it’s not exactly traditional since it’s got mayo but the Italian combo from Court Street Grocers is one of my favorite sandwiches in the city | The FDNY hero (chicken parm with vodka sauce) at Anthony & Son in Williamsburg is the best version I've had. | This topic came up over the summer, which is how I discovered Panineria near Washington Square. | Both in Brooklyn: Dellapietras and Paisanos | R.I.P. G Esposito & Sons in Carroll Gardens 🐷 | Regina’s, Court Street Grocer and Parm have some good ones. | Anthony & Sons in Williamsburg! | In this house Columbus was a hero — end of story 🤌🤌 | Filoncino in Staten Island, Brennan and Carr in Brooklyn, and roll roaster in Brooklyn too! | Super Mario and his brother Luigi | My gf loves the one at lenwich | One of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had in my life | How can I forget! Will put it on the list. | Casa is incredible | Was looking for this honestly one of the best sandwiches in the city and none of the insane hype. Get the chicken special. The parm and meatball are also both solid. | The chicken special here is one of the best sandwiches I’ve ever had. | Smoked trout is killer | This looks right up in alley! Will give it a go soon. | Anything with his homemade eggplant caponata…the stuff of dreams. | This guys food is AAA and he’s hilarious | The links are god tier! Sorriso's and Roasario's are going on my list! | Thank you! I will had Fiore's for sure, I've heard many great thing about Jersey sandwich places. Never heard of Charlie's, will have to check them out. 
Yes Paneantico is under the Royal Crown umbrella (as well as Filoncino), awesome places. | This place serves _meals_. One sandwich is easily enough for lunch and dinner, and they’re bomb. I would move back to FiDi for this restaurant alone | Oh yes, how can I forget Pissilo, will add them. | When I worked in an office down by Pissilo about a decade ago, that job/company was the cutthroat type where most people esp junior staff would eat lunch quickly at their desks. But whenever I went to Pissilo I would make sure to book a private meeting room so that I could enjoy that sandwich without anyone seeing me. No way to eat a Pissilo sandwich gingerly! Spot is great and def worth checking out for true sandwich heads.  | Ah that must be it, good to know. | And there's a Regina on ues too | Don’t sleep on the cheesesteak hoagie there either | Hmm, homemade pizza dough bread entices me for sure! | They will also make the sandwich with vodka sauce if you ask! | Damn this place looks so no frills. Moving this to the top of my list | +1 for Carmentos | I know! Such a Staten Island classic. I love Ralph's across the street after Denino's as well. | I second this place. They also have amazing homemade prepared hot foods. | thirding this. right off the D train at 25th avenue. must try | Added, looks spectacular! | Awesome 😊 | Love it!!! | I think it closed? https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fp2YdZ5SqqJtwiq4A?g_st=ic | Definitely adding this, the hype there is real. | Personally I think losurdos and Vitos in hoboken make a better Italian than fiores. Fiores has a whole thing about not using veggies so their Italian isn't standard, damn good roast beef though

Ah misread it as Italian subs but still losurdos has insane hot subs though it's closing soon | There is own in midtown now | No hot subs there. (Going there later today love it) | 17 on semolina is my go-to, and not too overwhelming.  If they’re out of semolina I’ll turn around and come back another day. | Idk if there’s a Regina’s on the UWS, but I was referring the the UES location. I see now it looks like I was comparing it to the UES Milano Market lol (which I was- haven’t been to the UWS for MM either) | My go-to is the Special Cheesesteak with mushrooms and red peppers! | Ooooh! I love their house sauce and they're always super accommodating if you ask for extra sauce (I'm a dipper!) but I'll try it with vodka sauce ❤️ | sure is.  clam pies ! | Good to hear, because I was missing the Chelsea one when it shut down"
Flushing…. Spice!,I have adequate knowledge of the spots in Flushing.  Going next Sunday late morning…. Start with the Portuguese egg tart.  My buddy really wants some spice tho.  Obviously the chili wontons at white bear are great but some might say it’s not the spiciest… so any good recommendations for some killer spice?  There’s the burger place right?  Forgot the name,"- Chongqing Lao Zao

- Szechuan Mountain House | [deleted] | Yeah I think Chingqing gonna be the move.  Get spicy broth and the peppercorn pork right?

Can we talk pies? ,What’s everyone’s favorite place to order pie for the holidays? Brooklyn locations only. ,"Petee’s & four and twenty blackbirds are my favorites | Little Pie Company - sour cream apple walnut for the win | -	Four and Twenty Blackbirds
-	Petee’s Pies
-	By Clio
- Steve's Key Lime Pies | Peetie’s is amazing. I did a taste test of a bunch of pie places because I had pie instead of wedding cake and they blew all of the others out of the water.

I find four and twenty blackbirds especially mediocre for what it’s worth | Have been happy with pies from Martha's in Williamsburg and L'Impremerie in Bushwick previously. Went with Petee's this year. | Mias is great | Peetes. But for pecan…Big Booty Bread 👏 - the crust is like nothing I’ve ever had and the pie is soooooo caramelized and tasty. | Ill get downvoted to hell but l’industrie or best pizza (grandmas’s only) | Banana cream pie from Pies n Thighs in Williamsburg | Briermere Farms In riverhead Long Island | The Good Batch | Citarella | We ordered Wednesday pickup from Baked in Red Hook (1 apple pie, 1 pecan pie). | Bubbys | Petees pie co! My favorite pie there is the black bottom almond chess pie…a year round classic. | I don’t like pies at all. And I destroy Petee’s every time there’s one around | She might have sold out of Thanksgiving preorders but Cait’s Key Lime is beyond delicious! | I'm doing pies n thighs and radio bakery this year, and am also tempted by the ube pie at wayan 😭 | Little cupcake shop does an amazing key lime pie bar. The whipped cream is NOT sweat and a little sour. So gooooood | A friend asks that I get a Costco pumpkin pie for her. Every year. I'm a Petee's person, but I'm happy to throw a giant cheap pie into my Costco Instacart order | Who has the best classic apple pie? Not crumble | Jean-George’s pumpkin pie is the best I’ve ever had. Got it at PerrySt. | Betty Bakery 

I recently discovered this place and here are their offerings for Thanksgiving:

https://bettybakery.com/collections/thanksgiving

They have smaller savory pies that are tasty as well 😋 | Bubbys!!!! | Its not NYC and I’ll risk listing it here but… delicious orchards in NJ! | Lassen & Hennings in BK Heights. Family owned and operated since 1949. Great pies!! | Pie & co in Greenpoint | Is Blue Stove still around in Brooklyn? | Do we have any savory hand pies since Dub pies closed? I really miss them. | Passionfruit pie from Kelloggs Diner in Williamsburg | I’ve gotten pies from Pies N Thighs before and those went over well. 
Milkbar also has some good pies though not like… fruit pies I don’t think. 
Cait’s Key Lime doesn’t have a physical location but is awesome. | Who in Brooklyn makes a killer pumpkin pie? Does anyone know this? | Poppy's in Brooklyn! | Poppy's | Rudy’s in Ridgewood | \+1 for four and twenty. love that place | Four & twenty is the only answer but you need to hurry up and order for this yr 😅 | Petee's easily. I go out of my way. It's accessible (never sold out, within a day) and delicious | Little Pie Company | Their sour cream apple walnut is the best apple pie ive ever had. Just perfection | Don’t have it in us to make our own this year, so we’re giving them a shot! Went with the sour cream apple walnut & Mississippi mud pies | My local diner serves their huge ""individual"" pies and that sour cream apple walnut is one of the tastiest things I've ever had. | They have a bk location? Definitely one of the best pies in the city. | Just got a custom cake from By Clio. Incredible!!!! | Happy to see byclio mentioned! Her cakes get all the attention but she has wonderful pies | Any other ones for people who can't have tree nuts? | hahaha pies, not pies. | This mistake could only happen in a NY/NJ sub. 🤣 | BRUH | Not me getting excited that they started putting out dessert 😭 | Omg their pies are INCREDIBLE. I wish they had a city location. | Creampie gang rise up! | Did they do a pie in a jar?  I was out there doing a farm crawl a few years ago and got a pie in a jar and it was so good, but I couldn’t remember where it was again. | The cream pies specifically , no pun intended, ifykyk | What's best from there | What from radio bakery? | Delicious orchards slaps, they’re about to open a car wash across the street. It looks glorious | Not a classic pumpkin pie but ladybird does a pumpkin mousse tart that's really delicious. Also if you don't mind doing later than thanksgiving day, you can still order pumpkin pie from four and twenty blackbirds! | I love the one from pies n thighs | They’re already sold out for this year 🥲 I tried to order one on Monday and it was already donezo | I dream about the maple whipped cream on top of the pecan pie. Insane. | Ah right… thanks & fixed | I ate my first sour cream apple walnut pie and was *very impressed*. Looking forward to more. | Omg im embarrassed. | But speaking of savory Pies - M Wells does a fantastic Tourtierre - i order one every year to bring to the fam. | Same lol | Don’t believe so | Again, I’m not a pie guy. The sour cherry crumb and the chocolate chess pies are soooo good. | Sold out now but I got the caramel apple pie https://www.radiobakery.nyc/preorders | They have pies available for walk ins I’d check the dates | They live rent free in your head! | Nice I was going to put in an order the sour cherry looks amazing | If you remember, let me know what you think!"
"Fuzhou style peanut butter noodles and wontons from QQ Cafe located in Manhattans Chinatown, both cheap and delicious!",,"Love those peanut butter noodles so much! | I thought they closed down? They reopened somewhere else??? | Looks yum | Putting this on my list to try next week! | Doesnt look appetizing. Hard pass | I remember when they used to be $1.50. Now they’re $3.50 😢 | Nope, they’re still open! It’s easy to miss since the store is so small but keep an eye out because it’s definitely still open. location is East Broadway | Yes! Support these small businesses | Pic def doesn't do it justice. Looks like gravy on plain noodles.

But the actual sauce is a sesame paste/peanut butter/soy sauce combo that is nutty, savory flavor with a tinge of sweetness that pairs really well with the wanton noodles. | Still an incredible deal though! | You can make the sauce at home for super cheap! It’s really easy, just mix peanut butter + Chinese black vinegar + a dash of sesame oil. If you don’t have the vinegar then soy sauce works too. | Good for them! | Love the places by the East Broadway station, they don't seem to get as much tourist traffic as the Canal/Grand St places and I want them to thrive but I also like it when us residents get a leg up ;) | ""wanton noodle"" LOL. ""Put your wanton noodle back in your pants!"" | Right like where would you get a plate of delicious noodles for $3.50.  I still think the dumplings are cheap as hell too!! | Thanks for this!! | Exactly!! I love the local places, you can always tell a place is good and authentic if you see many Asian elders there! | They’re 3 dollars at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou! Not sure if they are as good though to be fair | Yea I can order 4-5 items and be at or under $20 | Walked into New Arping a few weeks ago—100% Asian customers | Think I've only ever been to Shu Jiao Fu Zhou and not this place.  Sorry for the confusion will have to try though. | It's amazing!"
Does Ceremonial Bakeshop have the best breakfast burrito in the city?,"Tried Ceremonial Bakeshop today for their breakfast burrito. I saw another social media post (I know, I know) tout them as the best breakfast burrito in the city and one of the top 5 breakfast dishes in the city. I stood in a line that was outside the door and waited 30 minutes for it to be made. After all the waiting, I tried it and it wasn’t too bad. I’m not dying to get it again, but I’d get it if I knew I didn’t have to wait so long. It had chorizo, egg, potato and I got mine with avocado. 

The only other breakfast burrito I’ve tried (that was memorable at least) was the one served on Thursdays at The Blue Light Speakcheesy in Greenpoint. That one had braised cabbage, fingerling potatoes, eggs, avocado and you could get some type of meat added. This was also very good.

How to make deli Udon,"Kind of a weird request here, but I’m trying to track down a recipe for the Sanuki udon soup stock that you can get at various midtown delis (like Bread and Butter, Sunac, etc). Often served with your choice of noodle (udon, soba) and toppings like a salad bar. 

I’ve made traditional udon broth with dashi, mirin and soy, and the deli style broth base is MUCH darker and more savory. 

Anyone have any idea what I’m talking about? Any advice? Thanks!","I have noticed that the deli Udon broths tend to have a TON of ginger, throw in a couple of peeled knobs cut into big enough pieces to easily strain out? | Have you tried Hondashi instant dashi with any random bottled not expensive mentsuyu and mirin? Alternatively also Korean or Japanese niboshi and kombu might have been added for some quick flavor. You can get all of this stuff at H-Mart or JP/Chinese markets. I do this at home for quick fixes and it's easy. I do not think any of these delis are out here making a proper scratch-made broth or dashi for these bowls lol | They use real kombu and katsuobushi. And soak for 8+ hours. The stuff you get in a packet will never be the same | Just use ninben tsuyu no moto. Japanese food is so processed that it’ll take forever to get what you want. Has to be ninben - all the other brands don’t taste the same. 

Also the deli stuff probably uses the same thing (with a few extra things to make it taste good). 

Source: grew up eating Japanese food and lived there as a kid. | I've never had the dish, so this is totally off the wall, but some random thoughts:

For darker: Dark soy?

You could try the sorta normal list of 'umami bombs':

* Nutritional Yeast (Nooch)
* Fish Sauce (probably not)
* Worcestershire
* Mushrooms! (this would be my first thought really, either dried or just straight up powdered, porcinis or shitakes)
* Reduce your dashi?

Maybe sesame oil? Or another flavorful fat? Like they do for ramen tare sometimes?

Maybe straight up make another soup and then soup it up with the standards (dashi, mirin, soy).  Maybe make a veg stock with a bunch of charred up alliums and other aromatic veg trimmings, boosted w/ dried mushrooms and kombu.  Then make a tare w/ fat, dark soy, dashi, mirin?

Straight up just add some MSG. | OP, the answer is Mentsuyu soup base. It's a liquid soup base in a bottle, and not only you can use it as a soup base for your udon soup, you can also use it as a dippinh sauce for cold udon/soba. It is concentrated so you have to add water to adjust to your tastebuds. Also can be used for other Japanese dishes, had been using it to make myself gyudon or oyakodon. | MSG | I also use kombu and katsuobushi to make my own homemade dashis and I find it’s not the same | Just wanted to say I switched to dark soy and tried adding a bit of miso paste and I’m already feeling closer! Gonna try incorporating mushrooms next time I go to the store. | This is super helpful, thanks!!! | Dark soy may not be it - most of these shops are run more by Koreans and from my experience if anything they're using Korean soup soy for this kind of thing instead. Many Korean soys in general can get you that darker color without being intense and overtaking the flavor like a lot of accessible JP shoyus can. That flavor might be what the miso is accomplishing in that combination as well. | What makes a Korean soup soy?

I was actually thinking Chinese dark soy purely for color.

I'm barely familiar with Chinese soys and the existence of tamari, I've got zero knowledge on Korean soys and I just learned that there's Thai soy options. | > Korean soup soy

Thanks for contributing to nothing :) | City crab | 60% of restaurants close in 1 year and 80% close in less than 5. 2017 is really close to a decade ago. In fact, in 6 weeks, it’ll be 8 years. Meaning there’s a 1 in 5 chance the place is still open. And that’s before factoring in that it’s NYC, which is ultra competitive, and that COVID destroyed the business, especially in NYC.

Your post is laughable, and I made a joke about it. 

I wonder if Dorsia is open.

Since you’ve been living under a rock, and this sub is filled with know nothings, here is a decent article to quickly sum up the state of the industry: https://www.businessinsider.com/restaurants-america-eating-out-crisis-your-fault-labor-shortage-tipping-2024-2 | That was my next guess! | I don’t live under a rock, I don’t live in Manhattan. Since you seem to be into percentages, Manhattan houses only 2% of total restaurants in the USA, so not sure why anyone would keep tabs on the turnover of restaurants in NYC unless it affected their everyday lives. Again, not the point of this post - if you feel the need to poke fun of me that’s fine, but I find that laughable."

Sunset Park Chinese roast: Ng's Kitchen vs Uncle Ng's Recipe,"Came across them on the sub as the ""new"" ones to try, and minor confusion over their names.

They're both the same people, same owner. I tried them over two days thinking they were different but I confirmed it on the second day at Ng's Kitchen.

So I think it's the luck of the draw, assuming there's the OG chef, and they have one or two apprentices/help, they must be rotating between the two.

It's very good Chinese roast, I was very pleasantly surprised and this will be my go-to until something changes or I want King's Kitchen (already tried Lucky 8, Roast 28—been eating Chinese roast 40 years of my life and 12 years in NYC).

I took pictures to share because I was so impressed. Same orders: 3-Treasure option lets you pick 3 meats over rice for $9.25 (most expensive IIRC, everything else is less).

My basics for taste test is usually roast pig, char siu, and roast duck. I also ordered ribs from both places to take home.

[Day 1 Uncle Ng's Recipe.](https://imgur.com/a/uncle-ngs-9Q7KDLv) ([Location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uc2Ypwr9eM5xo5529))    
The roast looks perfect to me. Crisp skin, no excess grease giving a very clean mouth feel, well and full flavored. The roast pig was tender-firm giving a nice bite. But overall surprisingly lean and could've done with a bit more layer of fat under the crispy skin and between the meat.

Their char siu is more purist to me—less treacly and overtly sweet. You know what I mean if you dislike Mei Lah Wah. More savory and the sweet comes after, vs other types of honey-glazed char siu. Also lean cuts.

The roast duck was perfect. Succulent and not too fatty again. Biting into the meat released all the flavors and jus and oil. I tried to show the pink in the center.

[Day 2 Ng's Kitchen.](https://imgur.com/a/ngs-kitchen-ExGN6gx) ([Location](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vdqJtxcSCtXAq6uj6))   
Obviously the flavor profiles are the same or similar. But the meats here were richer/fattier and the flavors seem more receded compared to Uncle Ng's. I don't think I can say either one is better at this point, just different experience.

The BBQ ribs are basically bone-in char siu. They warmed up well in the air fryer. These are usually served chopped into pieces but I prefer them as strips—perfect for the munchies.","Interesting to hear that they're the same owner because the two locations are literally a 5 min walk from each other lol. I'm surprised that they didn't go for a 2nd location in Bensonhurst instead. 

AFAIK Ng's Kitchen was the same owner/chef as the roasted meat stall that used to be in the Fei Long food court. They opened Ng's Kitchen after the food court closed down from COVID. | Do you have a recommendation for Manhattan’s Chinatown? | They both look good and cheap too! | Addresses please? | Wah Fung’s if you ask anyone younger than 30. 

Big Wong if you ask anyone older than 50.

Personally, I don’t think Big Wong was as good as it used to be. Their chefs got poached by a competitor over 20 years ago and their roasts are nowhere near as good. With that said, there’s a distinct flavor to their char siu that’s very nostalgic to me. Though the issue was never their flavor, but how they tend of overcook their char siu nowadays. You might have better luck if you specifically request fatty cuts. | Oops, updated the post with their locations. | Facts! Aren’t all the other “Wongs” offshoots started by former chefs? Like Yue Wong, Xing Wong etc. Altho many of them seem to be unable to get more than a C rating these days so I honestly hesitate bc my stomach isn’t as ironclad as it used to be! | Thank you! Will be there next weekend. | I wasn’t aware of the other Wongs being owned old Big Wong chefs, but I’ve been to Xing Wong and it didn’t really remind me of Big Wong’s Char Siu. A lot of char siu tends to be over sauced and too sweet nowadays. Meanwhile, you can still taste the spices at Big Wong. It’s how I remember char siu from the 90s to be like."
PSA: You can now place a pick-up order for Adel's,"Despite how viral they went and the long lines, at the end of the day, their chicken over rice is one of the best in the city. 

I found out recently that you can now place an order on Grubhub for pickup. No more waiting in line for 2 hours to grab a plate.","How much is a chicken and rice platter at the stand? I’m curious what the delivery markup is if it shows up as 16.72 in the app. | They can’t even manage the line they have now.  This is fucked. | I was a sucker and waited not worth it | This place is directly outside my office. I’ve had it before, but I don’t see the hype. It was good, but the same as any other halal cart food I’ve ever had | Adels is 100x better than Halal Guys but it's pretty mid and overrated at this point. Just go to Royal Grill down the street. | I don’t see why there aren’t more Egyptian halal carts. That’s the biggest difference between Adels and the majority of other carts in that area. Egyptian, Indian, Bengali, pakistani, and afghan halal all tastes different. Egyptian/moroccan halal tends to be the best. Adels is good but it ain’t with that line. There’s another Egyptian cart like two blocks away | Do any other carts use the same rice as Adele’s? | Overrated 

Most queens and Bk halal restaurants are better | Anyone have recommendations near ktown? I've been going to Sharif's which has been pretty solid. | Absolutely not worth it. I just don’t understand the hype, the food is so flavorless. Empire Halal on 3rd ave between 64th and 65th blows them out of the water | Idk why i have hard time believing halal carts are good. Does the food turnover or does it sit cooked for days | I think it's like 10 bucks. So the markup is like 60-70% | It was like 9-10 bucks if I remember correctly | Line during work day at like noon usually is like 20-30 but I only wanna eat em stoned watching my favorite tv show at home. If pickup isn't in normal line I will 100 percent pay 16 bucks to skip it. | 2 hour wait for halal? No thanks. | My SO and I love Adels but describe them as “apathetic inefficiency”.  

We had hopes the lines would get better when they got an additional cart. But I think their problems are related to their order intake + platter queue processes. They commonly forget what you ordered and which sauces you wanted, which adds a back log when they have to ask what you (or another Adels employee) what you got again. The cart can only hold so many platters at a time - and it’s not enough to alleviate the demand.   | What’s a better cart then? | Ok this isn’t a good standard to go by though because EVERYTHING is better than halal guys. Hamburger helper is better than halal guys. | How can I tell the ethnic origin of different halal carts? Is it something you ask or are there other ways you’re able to tell? | I think OG Halal Guys before it was even known as Halal Guys was Egyptian. | Try out Midos, they also have spicy rice and is almost as good as | I go to a cart called Spicy Rice in Bay Ridge. | I like the cart on 41st directly across from Penn station and perpendicularly across from Paris baguette | Does the food turnover?  Just go have a look at Adel’s and the Halal Guys carts | Days??? Bro it’s a food cart | this question could be answered by simply having eyes | Come on bro? You're telling me $6.75 is worth more than 2 hours of your life? | Hell no what the fuck | I went yesterday it was oddly $11. I paid $13 total for a combo platter and $2 water. | Don’t they only open in the evening? | I’ve been saying the same thing for years.  My friends think I’m crazy, but their line management suuuucks.  I used to wait on peak 53rd & 6th line back in the 2000s that were equally as long, if not longer.  Never took as long as an Adels line. | Royal grill is pretty good is by 44th if I recall. | Royal Grill down a few blocks during the day, and Shawarma bay a couple blocks up at night | Not sure why you were getting downvoted. You weren’t arguing Adel’s the best, just that you wanted to know what a better alternative was. So do I. Thanks for asking! | https://www.overrice.nyc/

Most carts are functionally identical. None of them are worth waiting on line for, and adel's is overhyped Instagram transplant fodder. | Midos is comparable in terms of taste (a close #2 to Adels), but with a more pleasant experience. They are efficient and quick with handling large volumes of orders. 

Halalguysguy recommended Shawarma Bay but I haven’t been.  | Midos | There's a chase bank on liberty street in the fidi that used to have the best halal anywhere. | They all suck dude, they're carts. | Halal guys used to be the goat but ever since they started franchising locations it all went downhill. | Bengali/indian/paki you can usually smell as the seasoning is different and I eat so much halal at this point I can just smell it from the cart. But I honestly just ask. “Hey brother where are you from”. If I like the answer I order. If the answer is a halal food I don’t like, I just say “awesome have a nice day”. Both answers have always been met with a smile. | Yup! They are Egyptian | Second this. Midos is the best and not even close to the same wait | Second this. Midos is the best and not even close to the same wait | $7 to save 2 hours of waiting in line sounds worth it to me. | Yes 6pm onwards. | Waiting on an Adels line is a painful experience. I rarely go anymore because of it  | They even give you card, and if you collect 10 stamps you get free food | shawarma bay is unreal | Preach | you ask them where they’re from and order based on that? ngl that’s kinda fuckin weird dude. 

also its literally chicken over rice you don’t need to be a connoisseur | Seriously. Not to brag but I think my time is worth more than $3.50/hr | Is it *that* good, damn | Probably why the line is so short during the work day at noon......because it's a different cart lol. | I had shawarma bay with my friends and it was meh. I wouldn’t go out of my way to get it but if I was there I’d get it | Not weird at all.  Different countries spice and cook the same ingredients differently.  Asking where you are from (or just listening to the accent they speak or to the music they are playing) can be indicators of which way they prepare chicken and rice | what’s weird to me is that you’re assuming 5-10 different countries all make the exact same food the exact same way. I’m not a connoisseur, I just have the average taste buds of a average person ☠️☠️☠️ Sure it’s “just chicken over rice”, tell that to the folks on the two hour line at Adels everyday. | No, I waited 30+ mins, which is considered short, and I wouldn't do it again. There are other chicken and rice carts that are nearly as good | It is that good | It’s fine. | Exactly | i really think the difference in your street cart chicken and rice is going to be negligible whether it’s a pakistani guy or an egyptian guy making it. and not ordering from someone based on their race becauee you think you’re some kind of halal cart expert is sooo weird and pretentious 

hey man where you from? india? ok see ya later! | I wouldn't say anything to people waiting on a two-hour line for a halal cart because those people are idiots. | yeah you’re right. asking a small business owner where they’re from and not ordering their food because you don’t like the answer is totally not weird at all. you’re right man 👌🏾

and this thread is full of people saying “adels is not that good, just go to another halal cart” so not sure the point you’re making other than people are sheep and follow whatever they see on social media | You are clueless about either taste differences or about the socioeconomics of the food cart business, or both.  

Much of what you taste in any food is the spices used in cooking it.  Indian cuisine uses different spices from Egyptian cuisine, from Greek cuisine, from Moroccan cuisine, from Chinese cuisine, etc.  You can't taste that difference?

Food carts and other street vendors are entry points for immigrants from different countries and they hire workers from their own community (Greek food carts when they were abundant in NYC hired fellow Greeks, Egyptian food carts hire fellow Egyptians, Pakistani food carts hire fellow Pakistanis, etc.) and ergo they spice and cook the chicken, rice, or whatever based on their cultural  background and cuisine.  

It's not the case with food carts that they hire any ethnicity like say Wendy's, or other standardized chains where the food is the same regardless of the worker's background.

Hope that's clear. | i actually think you’re clueless. if you think they’re using any spices besides cumin, garlic, ginger, kashmiri red chili, salt, pepper, all spice, turmeric, curry powder, garam masala to season their chicken you’re wrong. it’s not like different countries have spices exclusive to them that no one else uses. 

bringing greek and chinese food into this is some weird strawman argument you’ve concocted. all i said is chicken and rice isn’t going to differ significantly from cart to cart. they douse that shit in white and red sauce anyway so to think you can inherently tell the difference is laughable. 

HoPe ThaTs ClEaR | Digging yourself further and further down a hole, eh?  

Egyptian cooking doesn't use a number of the spices you mentioned.  Will leave it to you to figure which, if you have the sense to taste for yourself or to ask any one of the Egyptian vendors (but oh no, you would never ask a vendor which country they are from). | my point was outside of those combination of spices you’re not gonna be seasoning it with much else. but whatever you say, you’re the halal cart expert 🫡"
"Planning trip to ny, are my food spots any good?","Hello! This is my first time going on a trip to new york! (I’ve been there for a concert and for about an hour once, but I’ve never been able to explore the city. It’s always been my dream to go on a trip like this, and I finally have my chance! I’m going Jan 2-5 (while bryant park winter village is still open!!!!!!) and I’ve been doing some research on places to get food! I have a google maps link, just tell me whats good on my list and what i should add too! (note: i’m a vegetarian and I don’t like eggs or mushrooms that much, i’m also going with my family who literally will eat anything) [https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZWodV9cyMLYM6x2Q7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZWodV9cyMLYM6x2Q7) tysm!!!!","I'm assuming you're Chinese since some of the destinations are written in Chinese so here's some more Asian focused recommendations.

**Nearish CafeBy2 in East Village:**

[Cha-an](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tSWohw9mgwQLW8iV8) is a OG Japanese dessert spot/tea shop. Absolutely love their signature black sesame creme brulee dish. They have good tea too. Never tried their non-dessert/regular food.

[Ando Patisserie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2xXYrCpfSkxc17Bu8) is a ""modern"" French-Chinese bakery dessert spot. Chinese food tends to be the cheapest cuisine so the prices are higher than what I like to pay but it's not really that much more expensive compared to other dessert spots. There really isn't any ""modern"" Chinese dessert spots so I love that they're making a good attempt on it.

\---

**A Salswee companion:**

I've never heard of Salswee until now so I've never been there.

However [Patisserie Fouet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e5RWQH9hUHW1zJyp7) is like 1 subway stop/10 min walk away and they are a excellent French-Japanese pastry spot. It's my favorite dessert spot in the city. I've never done it but they also have a 3 course dessert tasting menu with optional wine pairing.

Again I've never been to Salswee so I don't want to shit on them and I will hit them up the next time I'm in the Flatiron area. But I find it hard to imagine that it's better than Patisserie Fouet just because I like Patisserie Fouet a LOT lol. You can hit up both and compare.

**Misc:**

[Lady M](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JCBnTCwDD45z7Q4A9) might be worth a try and they're across the street from Bryant Park. They're known for their crepe cakes. All my Asian friends love them but personally I rather have a regular cake lol. Note that they have a ton of locations so you can go to any.

[Bibble and Sip](https://maps.app.goo.gl/quGkccoxzCxDpEWa6) is a super cute cafe and bakery. They have cute ass cakes and cream puffs and cute Totoro macaroons. It's near Rocketfeller so you're bound to be near the area at some point.

IMO I would skip Food Gallery 32. Most of the stalls are very mid and there's too many better food options in Koreatown to spend a meal at the food court. If you want hotpot in the winter time, [Hakata Ton Ton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FZGZiGgm9jtJp72A6) is nearby and does a excellent Japanese hotpot that serves 2 people. | Din Tai Fung is a chain, which means that (depending on your life circumstances), it is likely you would be able to eat at a DTF somewhere else in your life. If it was me, I would probably deprioritize it or remove it completely and replace it with a restaurant or food you could truly only get in NYC. 

The problem I have when I travel is that there are only so many days and so much room in my stomach, so I try to deprioritize restaurants that aren't necessarily only eatable at that location.

Another problem I have is trying to figure out the ""best"" dishes to order at a restaurant. The waiters always end up just saying ""everything is good here"". You could try using [Dishr](http://dishr.sefino.co/?ref=r1) if you have that problem as well; it looks through google reviews to pick out and rank the most positively mentioned dishes. | About Food Gallery 32, we probably will not get any food there, but I know they have some cute shops and they have some kpop murals which seem really pretty | also those recomendations look really good! crepe cakes are my favorite so I’m definatly buying something at Lady M :) | Ding Tai Fung is my dream restaurant. I’ve never been to anywhere that Ding Tai Fung is located, nor does it seem like I will in a long time. Yes, I know it’s a chain, but I’ve been wanting to go there for a years. I’ve pretty much already decided what I want (I’ve been eyeing the menu for years now) and I’m vegetarian so I have some options. If I was able to go the flagship location in Taiwan, I wouldn’t even have it on this list, but it’s been a dream of mine to go for a while now. | Ah, I haven't been in there for a while so I don't remember if there was any cool murals there. It's always worth a walkthrough!

There's also a [Koryo Books](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zMFjkHMmj9qaCczP9) on the same block and a [KPop Nara](https://maps.app.goo.gl/z8mmw5Ek45uuhwvo7) shop a block away if you're specifically looking for Kpop stuff. Probably worth a walk through if you're planning to go to Food Gallery 32 anyway. | Defiantly going to those shops! I have been to New York already (I came for a concert) but didn’t spend that much time in the city itself, but I did go to Kpop Nara and Koryo Books and they are both great spots for kpop merch."

Staying in West Village - what am I missing and what should I replace?,"Headed for a week of comedy, jazz, food and drinks and such. I know things can change from year to year so looking if my food knowledge is up to date. For reference will be staying at Washington Square Hotel.


Bagels - current go to is Bagels on the Square. Looking for classic ny bagel, sometimes with lox


Pizza - honestly prefer Percys over bleeker st. But hoping to find a good upside down slice. Gonna try grandma ones unless steered elsewhere


Shawarma - lava shawarma’ looks great, searching this sub seems like omg shawarma is the foodies choice. 


Biang Biang noodles - went to Xi’an famous foods and was blown away. Willing to go wherever from chelsea to chinatown if someone has something better


Sandwiches - who you got faiccos or all’antico vinaio


Bars with pub food- actually not too sure. Looking for actual pub food like burgers and fries not croquettes or some shit. Happy hours on beer (and buy backs) are welcome


Cocktail bars with tapas - a good manhattan with something tasty will do","Arturo’s Pizza on Houston. Show some love | THE West Village. | I lowkey like Tavern on Jane for the pub food category.

Edited to correct the name. | Zinc Bar on w 3rd street is a great spot for jazz and cocktails. 
Comedy Cellar obviously is the best comedy spot - but you will need to make reservations. | I was shocked at how good [Apollo bagels](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2MXWKXPf8r8kA4kK7) (this is their new WV location) was the last time I had it. Maybe it was because I had to wait in line for 20 mins (had to wait for a friend anyway) and the dill lox bagel was fresh and hot. The everything bagel had a unique crispy crust but was still soft/doughy in the middle. It was the best bagel I've ever had because it's the only bagel that ever ""wow""Ed me.

I asked my friend if he wanted anything while I was in line and he said no. I ended up giving him half of my lox bagel with him because I know he likes dill and the lox bagel looked really good and I instantly regretted it after I bit into my half of the bagel because it was so good and I'm not about to wait another 20 mins in line lol.

The line was long because I went on Saturday in the morning, which is probably their peak busy hours. Maybe its not a bad thing to go at peak hours though because I feel like with small bakeries/shops, it's good to go when they are busy so you're guarantied to get their food fresh out of the oven/fryer.

\-----

West village is like the pizza capital in NYC. You have the OG spots at John's (pies only), Bleeker st, Joe's and the new comers at Mama Too and L'industrie.

[Mama Too](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fUcosXLYrUfRjDC17) specializes in square slices and they have a upside down slice. No idea how it compares to other upside down slices but their pizza is pretty good and worth a try.

I also really like the margarita slice from [L'industrie](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ifrC82qvZdQqNWpH6), which is around the corner from Mama too. Really crispy slice and delicious. They are supposedly known for their burata pizza but it's literally a scoop of burata plopped onto a regular margherita slice. The scoop of burata personally didn't add that much for me but probably worth trying since you're just visiting for a week.

Would strongly avoid going to L'industrie and Mama Too during the weekend because there's always a long ass line. It's really not bad during the weekdays whenever I walk by.

\----

[Spicy Village](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TWpwKytzD9KLTczVA) (not to be confused with ""New Spicy Village"" because they're not affiliated) in Chinatown is my alternative to Xi'an famous food. It's a small hole in the wall spot and I like that it's more ""local"" and more mom and pop vibes. Xi'an famous food feels more commericalized now that they got popular and have locations everywhere.

They have a spicy ""Big tray chicken"" with hand pulled noodles that serves 2 people for $20. You can split an order of soup dumplings and scallion pancakes and come under $20 per person for the meal. IMO it's one of the best deals in Chinatown/Manhattan.

\----

Honorable mention to [Pomme Frites](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qcVHvCvZNDDutuHT9), a small hole in the wall Belgium fries shop and they're around the corner from Blue Jazz. They make fresh fries and have over 30 sauces to pick from.

You can ask for a sample and they'll squirt some on a napkin for you to try. Just don't get the poutine because that's mid. I like the dill lemon and the sweet mango chutney sauce.

Also love [Janie's Life Changing Baked Goods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dsaicdhujDe49tKm6) for their unique pie crust cookies. They're down the block from L'industrie/Mama Too. | Bleeckers pizza isn’t good imo | Bagels on the square are terrible. Get Greenbergs if trying to stay close to that area. Apollo bagels has lox and is also good but always a line | Mamoun's Falafel should be on the list. Also, relatively new place but Cha Cha Tang has a wonderful HK toast.

EDIT: Missed the bars. Johnny’s Bar on Bleeker, Orient Express, Katana Kitten, and Donna’s specifically for a Bran Colada. | Walk down 8th St a bit and get Brooklyn Bagel. Far better. | I have it on good authority that spice brothers is the place to go for shawarma. | I grew up in the burgh!
. Anyway I get the need for bar food that’s for sure. Surprisingly hard to find a delicious nacho plate here….

Sandwich-assuming you mean, like an Italian sandwich -In that area I definitely recommend fiaccos for a sandwich. Also a sleeper fave is pisillos Italian panini.

pizza- MUST do mama’s too if you’re looking for a thicker upside down or grandma slice and frankly anything there. And of course the famed l’industrie-line goes quick during off peek hours. I second Arturo’s for like good Italian food including pizza and they have live music in the main room.

Bar food- honestly kinda hard to say. Blue haven Houston street has decent bar food, ppl say wogies wings are decent.  

Shwarma-taco mahal isnt technically that but really great! 

Jazz- mezzrow is great. 

Comedy-comedy cellar on McDougall or nothing you can show up right before Showtime and maybe get in standby tickets. You’d be surprised. I would try it if I were you. 

And bagels- gotta do Apollo, just go eaaaaarrly, pop up bagels is like “tiktok famous” -so cringe but I hear it’s good too

-Happy hour I love WXOU radio bar, great “dive” that reminds me of Pittsburgh, also art bar is great, there are many of other serviceable low-key bars with good happy hour | Washington Sq Park Dosa Man (NY Dosas) | Bagels on the square is my go to. Classic neighborhood spot. Never too crowded. Don’t listen to the haters. 

Lava Shawarma is amazing. Another good spot that just opened... OMG Shawarma. Top tier. 

Pizza - im ride or die for BSP haha. L’Industrie is great, But usually has a line. Little Charli is fantastic and severely underrated but not a by the slice spot. 

Bonsignour if you need another sandwich spot. 

Pubkey has good pub food

Cocktails - bell book and candle (neighborhood spot not overrun with tiktokers), Entwine, Do Not Disturb, Bandits 

Demo if you want wine bar w/ amazing food vibes. | Made in NY Pizza has a good upside down square | Mamas too and John’s of Bleeker but you have to get a whole pie at Johns’s they have a smaller 6 slice option, might be a line though. | 1. A slice at Joe’s on Carmine (technically on Carmine, actually on Sixth Avenue) late (like after midnight)

2. Elephant & Castle (Greenwich Avenue, where it meets Seventh Ave.). Been there for more than half a century — the quintessential West Village restaurant and the most underrated (NOT best; underrated) burger in the city — the Elephant burger.

And for some strange reason looking back twenty-one years, when #3 would have been Balducci’s, simply the best place in the world. | parisi for sandwiches !!! parisi > faicco's imo | Bagels - Apollo
Pizza - l’industrie or mama too’s
shawarma - 100% lava, it’s incredible and well priced (omg is way overpriced)
Cocktails - LB and Angel share | If you want authentic Syrian food Try Moustache. Get the oozi. And Ghandi cafe for Indian.  Also don’t miss Oscars for brunch. It’s British. It’s low key.  Delish. If you have kids cowgirl is cute. | L’industrie for pizza and Very Fresh Noodles for biang biang noodles, both are very close to you | Corner Bistro for burgers

Never go to Bleeker street

Mamoun's is always my personal fav shawarma 

WXOU for happy hour | Not a New Yorker, but when I’m in that neighborhood, Pommes Frites & Mamoun’s Falafel are my favorites. Limited menus, but delicious. | You should just go to popup bagel since it's close. Mamouns is great for shawarma and falafel. L'industrie pizza. Honest for really good Indian food. And for noodles--Very Fresh Noodle in Chelsea market is really good. I like it more than Xian famous foods.  | Industrie in WV, 12 chairs, cafe panino mucho is underrated | I think id be too tempted to get the spaghetti with oil and garlic | lol god, please tell me you are making fun of people who do this and arent actually someone who does this | I live in West Village. No one cares if you say “The” West Village | seconding this! very good burgers (tbh better than Corner Bistro across the street) and excellent fries. | Yeah already got my reservations for the cellar. Still mulling over which shows at smalls/mezzrow. Trying to spend more time this trip trying lesser known spots as the musicians are typically great every where | Both Apollo and Mama Too over overhyped. The only reason for Apollo though is you like lox and that’s their specialty. Lox on a burnt bagel. I really like Bagel Pub. Julian’s has a great cheeseburger for a bar. And you can grab VanLeeuwen’s for dessert. Your trip sounds fun and yummy. I’d also recommend going to Shu Jiao Fu Zhou, some of the best Chinese noodles. It’s not far from the WV. | Hell yes my friend. That fresh dill looks freaking good at apollo. Definitely saving all these (and thanks for the google map links making it easy for me). Pomme frittes is absolutely gonna get hit up at the comedy cellar | Spicy village was great once I added the hot chili oil to it. Still think xi’an is special though | It’s gone down hill the last 5 years | Yes was not impressed in the slightest. Had to head up to suprema afterwards to scratch the slice itch. | You have to forgive me but I live in the bagel desert known as Pittsburgh so bagels on the square is actually top 2 bagel I have ever had. Leons looked like it might be pretty good too | What? Bagels on the square is great. Are you lost | yah no Bagels on the square is great. One of the few places to do steak on a bagel sandwich in the morning. | Had Mamoun's a couple weeks ago; falafel was way dry. I'm willing to give them more chances, but was disappointed. | Cool those cocktail bars look interesting. Any appetizers from them that you recommend | Is the Chicken or the lamb the greater there? | Omg is def top tier that veal shwarma was fantastic and the schrug and sour cabbage are options I am not accustomed to that really brought it together. That pita bread though good lord is that good | Look at a map, it’s on Carmine. | I had both, chicken parm from parisi and chicken vodka parm from faicco's. Both were really good and definitely something special. 

I thought faicco's could have used more sauce and the cheese melted a bit more. But the bread was off the chains.

I thought parisi's had the better chicken parm but their bread, although good, wasn't crispy. | These are both in the village, not in the west village | Pop up sucks that you're mandated to buy 3 bagels and no I don't want to rip and dip my cream cheese | Their lasagna is pretty great | Maybe not in Ohio. | You’ve lived in THE west village for what a year? You want a cookie? | The natives do. 

Source: Native | Thank you. | Ditto | That's why I mention Zinc Bar - they typically have a lot of international jazz there, and they are just off the beaten path of touristy places in the village. | Went to shu jiao did not disappoint and bagel pub was very good, small line, fresh bagels with a huge schmear | Apollo makes their bagels to order, so expect to wait 5 minutes even if there isn't a line. | You can also try Very Fresh Noodles at Chelsea Market. People love em but there's always a long ass line and personally I don't think it's worth the wait.

I started going to Xi'an when they only had the one home in the wall location in Manhattan under the bridge with an Asian aunty cranking out noodles.

Maybe Xi'an's food is still good but for me, it doesn't hit the same now that they have a million locations in Manhattan, it lost the whole ""hole in the wall hidden gem"" vibe that made it special to me lol. I also feel like they watered down the spice level. | Only thing it has going for it is its open late for drunk slices but I’ll take Joe’s on carmine all day over it | Bagels on the Square IS great, especially their herbed sourdough bagel (which is worth a try if you want to switch it up!) | Leon’s is great! | It’s the same in the UWS location tbh | Katana and Donna’s have food. Katana is izakaya style. | [deleted] | That's good to know. I haven't been back to Apollo yet and I was afraid that going there during non peak time would result in a disappointing bagel. | You particularly would LOVE Levain."
Historic drinking chocolates in NYC?,"I used to live in Raleigh, NC, and there was an amazing chocolate shop called Escazu that served a variety of historic drinking chocolate recipes from around the world at the bar. Much less sweet and thicker than modern hot chocolate with interesting flavor additions. I can and do order their drinking chocolates online to make at home, but is there a local place serving this type of stuff in the city?","Bruh | I know that this post is more specific than the others, but damn, fourth hot chocolate post this morning alone. | L.A. Burdick in SoHo

https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-a-burdick-handmade-chocolates-new-york-5 | I think Max Brenner does something like this | Olive garden in times square might have it | Big Hot Chocolate is putting on an Aperol Spritz sized marketing push this winter | Really annoying | It’s insane. It’s also going to be 60 degrees today. | Yeah, the other post reminded me that I needed to ask this question. It’s the chocolate season! | Thanks so much! This looks great."
Are there any restaurants that still require strict dress codes?,It seems like these days no matter where you go to eat people wear whatever they want no matter how 'nice' the restaurant is. Years back some places required a jacket and tie. Do any places still enforce dress codes like that?,"River Cafe but they will loan you a jacket if you show up without one haha | Eulalie's whole appeal is a throwback to fine dining experience of the past: dress code required and you have to make a reservation by phone. well worth it! | The Grill won’t allow you in with shorts. | Not really an option for people to attend if you’re not a member or a guest of one, but New York Athletic Club requires a jacket for their dining room and bar | 21 Club used to lend you a jacket if you forgotten. | Daniel is the only one I know. | Plenty of restaurants don’t allow shorts and hoodies. 
If you will go to reviews you always find an angry 1 star on Google complaining about being turned off at the door because of their designer hoodie.
No one cares if it says balenciaga on your back, dress up appropriately.

When it comes to mandatory jacket it is rather uncommon. | Questions while we’re here - does The Nines enforce [their dress code](https://www.ninesnyc.com/dress-code)? Aside from not wearing anything on the refrain from list - what about less formal wear like jeans? | Le Bernardin | Per se required jackets for men 2018 ish? Not sure if still applicable | This is more of a bar, but last I checked, Dorian’s on the ues won’t let you in without a shirt w a collar.

Bemelman’s Bar at the Carlyle is similar, but I got away with a sweater that had a t shirt on underneath. | Le bilboquet | Le Pavillon. BUSINESS CASUAL ATTIRE IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. ATHLETIC OR LEISURE WEAR IS NOT PERMITTED AND GENTLEMEN ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WEAR SHORTS OR SANDALS IN THE DINING ROOM. (caps are from their website. Not Mine) | It's crazy how dressing these days is all the way down. People are eating at Nobu and high end restaurants in t-shirts, while there's nothing wrong with it, IMO dress up a little bit or a polo shirt at the least.  I get majority are tourists, etc but standards have gone down hill IMO | From the mid-aughts on there was a growing movement to get rid of dress codes, as their roots were in classism, to keep out the poors. And one by one most of the old restaurants dropped them - at least the ones that were trying to be modern. 

There’s only a few modern places I can think of that have them. Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare. While it briefly existed, Le Trois Chevaux, but now that they’re “Le B” they don’t anymore. 

Places like River Cafe or some of the old-school  steakhouses and Brooklyn Italian joints that still have codes are kind of relics. I’m not even sure how many of them are still doing it. Probably many of them dropped them as older diners aged out and younger ones weren’t interested. | Le Berdardin used to be quite strict about dress before the pandemic, but I think that has since loosened. Wealth signifiers have evolved over the past 10 years. Years ago my boyfriend wandered in after work and was lent a jacket just to sit at the bar. I don’t think that requirement existed when I was there last in 2022 but we were dressed appropriately nevertheless.

The Nines doesn’t have an explicit dress code but encourages patrons to dress “to the nines.”

Private clubs will have more rigorous dress codes. | Unrelated, but can’t help but think of those racist goons at Continental and their racial profiling dress code 🤦🏻‍♂️ | No hats in the dining room at Gallagher | Jean Georges: Gentlemen are encouraged to wear a jacket. No jeans, sweatshirts or sneakers allowed. | Chef's table at Brooklyn fare used to a few years ago at least | Don Peppe | Last I looked there were only 5 (?) restaurants left in all of NYC with a jacket policy, and that was years ago. Some other places have other dress codes, but the strictest policies are nearly dead.


I like it. People should be able to wear what they want, can afford, and feel comfortable in.  | Almost all places dropped the absolute requirement but will enforce it if you show up looking like a schlub. Don’t do that. Look nice, doesn’t matter what you wear as long as you’re easy on the eyes. Don’t come in with your platinum card looking like you just washed your car | The corner store has a weird dress code. Smart elegant but also at discretion of management seems like a prejudiced location | NOLA still does this in certain restaurants | Del Posto, and Per Se does if i remember correctly | Le Bernadin too. I got yeeted from there because my buddy had on shorts | Torrisi requires people to be “sufficiently well presented”. Not to the point of requiring jackets for men, but I always make a point to dress extra smart when I go there. Usually a blazer and dark jeans. | Knickerbocker Club in New York is private, but they have a dress code requiring jacket and tie and real shoes, i.e. no sneakers. | I think the old school steakhouses in Chicago still require jackets for the guys. | When I went to Le Bernardin about 11-12 years ago they required a jacket. I much prefer casual places personally. I've been to other places that have a dress code and I find they are usually style over substance. | Le Bernardin will let you come in in a button down and slacks, but when we went every single other party had on a Jacket and Tie.  I think there was one guy in another party w/o a tie. | Le B | Dorsia  | Yup, I enjoy eating at ""high end"" restaurants and never had an issue, because we don't dress like we're coming back from a Yankees or Rangers game. But, it happened to me at Bernardin about 10 years ago. 

I had a nice shirt, blazer, button cardigan on top, dark jeans (basic colours, nothing flashy) and my GF had a black dress with minimal design and Mary Jane style shoes that were bright ruby. I had black chuck taylors which apparently weren't ok and her shoes were ""borderline""

Safe to say we never attempted to go back. And, best part, we ended up finding a spot that night at Eleven Madison

GTFOH Bernardin | A lot of places had loaner jacket amand ties back in the day. | Huge fan of the loaner bin. | Thats kind of awesome. I want to go to a place so stuffy they make you wear a jacket. | Women too? Seems discriminatory if not | I recall their answering machine message regarding dress code said something like: think more Mad Men and less Grubhub. | love this spot, strongly recommend for great french food. | good. | The Century Association too, same thing | They also wouldn’t allow sneakers, even the office friendly smart kind | I can’t find this place online | Daniel got rid of the jacket requirement years ago. They’re “suggested” but that’s it. The only things they don’t allow officially now are shorts, sandals, and torn jeans, IIRC. The first two are really only rules for one gender and the last one isn’t a rule at all if someone’s a regular. | Daniel has a dress code but it is not jacket required . I saw plenty of button down shirts and nice jeans last time I went . | I love those rules ... especially if they prevent short sleeve shirts, which are tacky as fuck. And LOL, don't even get me started on ""dress t-shirts""

I hate dressing up, like miss me with wearing a suit and don't get me started on wedding attire etiquette, but you can easily wear something casual, look stylish and still not look like you're going to a bar, sporting event or family BBQ | No, they don’t, especially if you have a reservation. It’s more about overall vibe than any particular item of clothing. | They don’t require a jacket or tie. | I went for my mom's bday this past year and saw guests wearing sneakers and jeans, which I thought was ridiculous. I went for another birthday back in 2007ish and recall the dress code being strictly enforced - no casual footwear, jackets for men, women in either dresses or pantsuits.  

I'm no snob - like jackets being required is maybe a lil much, but is it so hard to wear black jeans/polo/dress shoes or a nice-ish dress instead of a literal tshirt, sneakers and light wash jeans to what's long been considered one of the best restaurants in the world? Fine dining is equally about the ~ambiance~ as it is the food and as someone who can only afford to go to those kinds of places once every few years, it's nice when they truly feel high end and fancy. | They aren't that strict. Mostly they just don't want bare arms on men, and frankly I don't want to see any when I'm there | They dropped the requirement. It’s just “business casual” now. | I think they still do! Husband had to borrow one of theirs first time we went. It was actually really nice lol | Most people still wore jackets the time I went in a few months ago (even in the summer!!). Business casual didn’t feel out of place tho. | They don’t care | Nobu has lost that tier of appeal imo. It’s basically on par with any other nice restaurant now. Coworkers and I do lunch / sometimes dinner there due to proximity and no one in my office “dresses up” | Nobu is a chain restaurant. When you look at it from the other direction, the idea of getting dressed up for a chain restaurant is kind of silly.

I mean, you can order Nobu takeout and eat it in your underwear on your couch while watching pro wrestling. At that point, thinking of it as a fancy restaurant just doesn’t jibe anymore. It’s expensive, sure, but no longer special. | Tourists probably come from places where dress codes are more common. What I like about this city is that nobody cares about my clothes. I don't go out to be noticed. Anybody who cares what I wear needs to get a life. 

It's always a shock when I visit friends out of town and they tell me that I need different shoes for dinner. | Lmao at considering nobu high end. | We went there right before the Chef Ramirez  fiasco and can confirm - it was the only 3 star in NYC that required a jacket. My husband was given one to borrow at the door. | Del Posto info is out of date but also false from my memory. | You can’t get into that place | There’s an entire Seinfeld episode about this | A lot of nicer places in New Orleans still do | It is not exhausting to be like this? | It’s closed. | Really? They told me jackets for Thanksgiving. I cancelled as a result. | This | Really? They told me jackets for Thanksgiving. I cancelled as a result. | And please leave the ball caps at home | Exactly. No one is asking you to wear a suit with a price tag on it, but no for some people it’s still to hard to comprehend with.

I work at the upscale restaurant and you have no idea how many calls per week reservations get with questions like:” can I wear a body suit” and stuff like that? We had a lady who was practically naked with tiny scraps of materials covering her nipples, butt and pus*y. 
She passed the doorman because she walked in wearing long winter coat 😝

People are wild. | Fr | It also reinforces a type of decorum. Certain vernacular is not appropriate. Do not use the phone at the table, etc | I think it's the changing attitude around what constitutes classiness. To me, a dress code doesn't actually make something nicer, it just makes it seem old and tryhard. | Why? What would happen if you saw a male elbow there? | I thought the second amendment protected that right from fancy restaurant overreach? Taking away my right to bare arms isn’t something I’d stand for. I don’t care how good the fish is. | Or worse - Bare arms plus hairy shoulders and upper back. I know Izakaya are more casual by design, but some guy was wearing a sports jersey and I could barely eat my noodles. 

No shade on the hairy, but time and place dude. | Sad | They don't. As the other commenter mentioned, it's business casual now and has been for at least 3 years. | Agree with you I just threw Nobu out there as an old benchmark of a ""nice"" place and agree with you.  Still crazy how much self standards and standards have dropped and while everyone deserves to do what they feel it's nice to make your self look great! | Totally agree I just threw Nobu out there like when it first opened.  I could list ten current expensive restaurants where people still show up in t-shirts.  The overaching point was the City has changed with dress code standards from what it used to.  Totally agree with you especially on the convenience part these days.... | I agree with you but on the same foot if you stepped into Le Bernadin with a t-shirts, slides, and shorts you'd look like a fool and out of place for good reason.  I can tell you that nobody cares for sure but people still judge and someone that's been in hospitality and service industry, you'll get a lot more positives your way throwing on something nice including perks rather than dressing down. Shoes are probably the least concern for me and people IMO but pants and top more important. | maybe outdated, but i was required to wear a jacket in 2018. either way didn’t realize it closed down, so irrelevant anyway | The only one that requires it is Galatoires. | On the reservation page it still says suggested, though maybe for T-Day they have special rules. | It's my understanding that they can't require men to wear jackets because gendered dress codes aren't allowed in NY. | [deleted] | Tony Soprano? Is that you? | Bianca Censori style | I worked in restaurants for a while and it's literally part of the appeal. Going to a bar or casual place on a friday night, or whatever, is one thing and going to an upscale resto is another. They don't all have to be the same

When i'm going to an upscale place, the setting and demeanor of the dining room is literally part of the experience. 

It happens in the fashion industry where every joe and jane can buy the latest designer bag because they can ""afford"" it. That literally defeats the purpose of it having a LV or Gucci bag. Soon women will all be walking around with Hermes bags.

It hasn't come here, yet, but the fashion in europe now is atrocious. Based pretty much on pandemic wear. Everything is baggy, loose and so on

Gonna be fun going to a restaurant and everyone is dressing like it's 1998 with jeans 4 sizes too big | Lol | Strongly disagree. I hate going to a very nice restaurant and seeing people dressed in streetwear. | Nothing! It's a dark room with dark details and the servers and sommeliers are mostly in black. All I meant by my comment was that I think the insistence on at least a long sleeved shirt suits the formality of the place | Can't control my sexual urges. | same experience, but guy was also wearing sandals and had filthy feet and with the tank top and shorts. Really did put me of my meal. | Oh dang haha. I guess it's been that long lol | I used to show up in dirty jeans when I worked around there 2016/2017. 

Jackets technically can't be required for men unless they're also required for women. At least if the law is followed. Though to be fair, restaurants in that family operated as if laws didn't apply. | Plenty of places still have dress codes in New Orleans, though most are just jacket preferred. But locals know which places to wear a jacket to, without needing a dress code statement. 

New Orleans is still a very formal town, uptown at least. The Quarter has become pretty informal, for tourists, which is why Galatoire's has to have loaner jackets. | Glad you corrected that because as someone born and raised in New Orleans I feel it’s one of the last places to enforce dress codes. No worries about being under dressed in New Orleans which is great because I never liked dressing up. Still don’t. | Could have sworn GW Fins had this policy too, but maybe it was only button down required | Just went and checked their email. Jackets are strongly required.

Hmm. Tempted to just show up in my jeans, polo shirt and sneakers, and give all the UES families something to stare at. | Huh. That’s pretty funny. I don’t want to upset anyone. I’ll stick with The Mark. They’re used fo my jeans and polo shirts. | Why are you here? | Where in Europe are we talking about?

I can’t say for the rest of US, but in post-pandemic NY we have a plague of gym outfits rather than a baggy sized clothes trend.
Whether you are in Manhattan or suburbs, every other chick wear yoga pants.
Thankfully it’s not that visible in Brooklyn and Queens for some reason. | No food for you with such language | The very nice part is the food though, not other people's outfits lol | I wont stand for bare arms personally. | Hell if I'm getting guessed up and wearing an uncomfortable suit I want everyone else to be the same!  

Seriously I think it elevates the ""specialness"" of fine dining. | Right, Galatoires is the only old restaurant that requires a jacket. | Collar and no flip flops or hats there, I believe. Unfortunate bc you get a lot of shiny bright colored golf shirts at dinner which is extremely informal IMO. Fins is in the Quarter though and places are still trying to come back from cofid closure losses, which is why I've heard they have relaxed dress codes, bc they need all the diners they can get. I went to Fins last week for dinner and a 50s couple walked in still holding their giant neon green tube hurricane drinks to check in for their table. | I mean, don’t do that. Dress codes are by and large a dumb relic, but showing up somewhere just to thumb your nose at them is equally dumb. You won’t be shocking anyone and literally no one would care or stare. | I'll send you a drink if I see you there. | Manhattan has gone to the dogs, especially post-influencer/social media culture. | Italy and Spain. On TV, celebs, athletes, etc and it bleeds into society.

Yoga pants and leggings have been around since I last left school in the mid-00s. Doesn't seem like a trend, I think it's literally a comfort thing | Incorrect. A true fine dining experience is both. | Far as I’m concerned the second amendment allows me to wear a short sleeve and go to any restaurant 😤 | Your suit doesn't fit if it's uncomfortable. Literally the most comfortable clothes I own are suits, not even really expensive ones. A tie is a little uncomfortable sometimes, but never a suit. Jeans are much more constricting than a pair of suit pants. | It definitely elevates the ""specialness."" | I… wasn’t planning to. That’s what I wear. Always. That’s why I cancelled. But from what people have said, I’m now wondering if it would actually be fine.

I wear smart jeans and sneakers and a plain Gant polo. I don’t dress badly. | Are you also there for Thanksgiving? | Dunno why you're downvoted; ambience/environment is literally factored in when awarding restaurants Michelin stars, and what guests are wearing is as much a part of the environment as the interior design, imo.  

Like, if you were served fine dining level food in a shabby, dive bar-esque establishment with loud music blasting and people dressed casually, it's still a fun and enjoyable experience (I actually love those kinds of places lol) but it's not actual fine dining and would never be classified as such. | If you're an 80 year old with nothing better to worry about, sure. Just dress how you want and don't worry about anyone else gramps. | Barbaric. | I’m sure you don’t. But for whatever reason they have a dress code on Thanksgiving that they don’t have the rest of the year. Since it’s a special occasion they’re be less likely to bend what rules they have. At best (and most likely) they’ll just give you a loaner jacket. At worst they’ll send you away and you lose your deposit. 

Anyway, buy a jacket. Having one handy for things like weddings and funerals isn’t trading in your freak flag to become a societal normie. It’s just convenient. | Sneakers, Jeans and a Gant polo does indicate dressing badly lol.

Not at all appropriate for a nice restaurant.  Have some respect for places you go and people around you.  SMH | No, but maybe another time. | Refreshing to see another voice of reason here lol thx | I'm in my 30s. It's called decorum. | Oh, I know that. I was going to go to The Armoury and have them sort me out, but I’ve been putting it off. I’ve only been here a few months, and with all the walking (and also now having hired a personal trainer), I’m slowly but steadily losing weight.

I’ll stick with The Mark this year. I’m sure it’ll be good, and I know they’re fine with the way I dress. I’ll do Daniel next year. Trim and sell-dressed. | Gotcha. | It's called shit grumpy old people with nothing better to do worry about. Grow up, the rest of the world has. | I don’t really have a dog in this fight, but some people want to be able to book a restaurant where everyone will be dressed up… Its not my cup of tea, but I don’t think its crazy for a restaurant to cater to that crowd..

Its like when I bought a condo, I picked a place that doesn’t allow cats or dogs because I am allergic… I hear neighbors complain about the policy… I get that its not everyone’s cup of tea, but some people have allergies and seek out such a policy.. its wild to acknowledge the policy, move there, and then complain about it after.

There are plenty of Michelin star restaurants that don’t enforce strict dress codes and there are some that do… make your pick for reservations and dress accordingly. Don’t pick one with specific rules and then cry foul at the specific rules after you booked knowing about them."

Keens or Peter Luger?,"I'll be visiting NYC next month and would love to treat my partner a steak dinner for his birthday celebration.

We are not picky eaters. I am sure both options are fantastic considering that we enjoy Keg steakhouse at a much cheaper price point lol. We usually don't spend too much on dining out. I don't really know much about steak but I still dream about the time I went to Italy and had Bistecca all Fiorentina. I'm hoping to have another enjoyable experience like this again but this time in NYC and with my partner! Anyways, we don't have sophisticated tastebuds and I just want to try one of the two steakhouses. We don't usually drink and I don't think we will be ordering other sides or appetizers... maybe a caesar salad? not sure if that's too basic. I don't have much preference about the atmosphere, as long as it is not too fancy.

I'd love to know what the locals think about these places, and if you have a preference! Thank you! :)","Keens | Keens, no question | Keens. | Between those 2? Keens.. | Lugers leans hard into this “obnoxious service is all part of the overpriced experience!” Thing. I don’t get it. 

Service at Keens is excellent. They take credit cards like a normal restaurant. Setting is just as historical if not more so. Request the Teddy Roosevelt themed Bull Moose Room. | I don’t live in NYC but I still think about my steak at Keens | Keens has much better service and atmosphere. | Keens all the way | Lugers is terrible now , 

Keens or even smith and wollensky | Lugers for the burger at lunch. Keens for anything else. | Everyone likes to shit on Lugers because of the service or the fact they got a bad NYT review or lost a Michelin star but the steak is still quality. Also, when i've gone the service is completely fine. Love Keens as well so I say you cant go wrong with either, but if you cant get into Keens dont feel like Lugers is a huge downgrade, it's not. | Been to both and hands down will return only to Keens! | Undoubtedly Keen’s | Peter Luger isn't what it used to be | I’ve never been to Peter Luger, but we recently ate at Keens and it was amazing. | Keens for sure but get at least one mutton chop. Even if you have it as an appetizer. That’s the real star. | Mutton chop from Keens and it’s not even close. | The better Lugers experience is in Great Neck to be honest. Amazing simple straight forward  steak. 

Brooklyn is more of the hype and id defer to Keens | Keens

Get the wedge and mutton. | Keens, try the mutton. It is my go to for special occasion. | From NYTimes in 2019, re: lugers… “Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole.” | Keens | Keens! The bartender in the upstairs room during lunchtime also makes the most perfect dirty gin martini. 

Edit - just read you dont usually drink - but still Keens > Lugers! | Between those two, Keens. | keen’s. peter lugers is overhyped garbage | Keens | Keens mint jelly is worth it on its own | Wolfgang’s | The ambiance, Keens. I thought Peter Luger’s had the best porterhouse. Why not go to both? | Why choose?  Both fantastic, and yes Lugers is still great despite NY times and others trying to knock it down.  Would go to either based on proximity | If you like the old school New York vibe, you may also want to try JG Melon (not for the bday dinner, another time). The line can be long if you go at a popular time.
Cash only but damn is that burger gooood. | Keens for sure. Luger's customer service is extremely straightforward which may be off putting to tourist and the like. The service at Lugers's is not apart.of the experience. The ambiance and the food are.



Keens  is about both. My wife and I went there for her birthday as first timers and had a great time. Our waiter was excellent. My wife and I returned for many years after. On e year I took my Dad and we had the same waiter as my first visit. He remembered my wife and I. Again...amazing. | Keen | Don’t go to Luger’s. They haven’t been top notch in over a decade. Their burgers are good but I think they only have it at lunch time. | luger for tastier steak, and excellent but gruff service

keens for better sides, more obsequious service, and fancy ambiance

pick based on whats more important to you | Keens. Two reasons:

1. The only thing Luger has going for it is the steak itself, which ranges from good (comparable to any first-tier NYC steakhouse), to extraordinary (literally not only the best meat you’ve ever had, but maybe the best thing you’ve ever tasted). We could have a 1,000 person sub-Reddit spend the next ten years arguing about how often you’ll get one or the other. In every other way, Luger is inferior to any of its competitors. Sides are mediocre, service is gruff, ambience is disappointing, and no credit cards are accepted.

2. The mutton chop at Keens. One of the great dishes of the city, an absolutely must try, especially if you have four or more in your party.

A final note. If you haven’t been to either, pick one and go. Full stop. But the best steak — and the best overall (steakhouse) dining experience I’ve had in the last five years was the Wolfgang’s on West 41st. Simply superb. | whichever you can get into. Love them both. | Peter Luger used to be excellent.  We stopped going after a few poor meals and have not returned.  I would go with Keens. | I wouldn't recommend the mutton chop at keens. It's a cheap cut for a reason. Their T bone was much better.  
UPDATE: Not that they make it badly, it's just not as good as another cut. It's popular but not great. | Benjamin steakhouse is far superior to both! Been to Luger and keen in the last year and was not impressed. | I didn’t like Keens the one time I was there. The service was both lax and rushed. My steak was overcooked. I ordered dessert that involved a scoop of ice cream and it arrived in a puddle. I did like Peter Luger and although the service was brusque, I was ready for it. My server gave me a huge to-go container of whipped cream  (with my other to-go container) just because he thought I’d like it. 

If you want a steakhouse, I’d opt for a place other than these choices. | THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR COMMENTS! I managed to make a dinner reservation for next month at Keen's and I'm really excited to try! :) | If you only care about the steak, I think lugers is better. Keens is more comfortable and probably the better restaurant. Lugers is cash only too. | Peter Luger, by far. The service is frustratingly bad - but the food is better than Keens. 

The only reason to pick Keens is if you want to be in the middle of the city and a few minutes from doing just about anything before/after dinner. Luger isn’t in a great neighborhood, so once you are done with dinner you will want to grab a cab to go to the next spot.

Now, if you want to just split the difference, also consider Wolfgangs on 33rd / Park. | I still like Luger to sit at the bar at lunch and have a burger, but for a proper meal Keens is the one. You'll have a much more pleasant experience, more reliable food, and much better wine and whisky (the Scotch list is one of the best in the city). | Keens all day, lugers is trash and the service is shit, they might as well spit in your face. Was there 2 weeks ago and it was terrible, never going back again. The waiters should be ashamed of themselves for being so snobby and ridicules. | Definitely Keens. If you want a PL experience in Manhattan go to Wolfgang's on Park. | Keens | Keens. | [deleted] | Keens all the way.   And you don't have to leave the island. | Yup. Been to both many times. The Keens experience is better. | Thank you! | Thank you! | I’ve never had anything but exceptional service at Lugers, idk where this whole “obnoxious service” thing came from. Based on comments you’d think it was like one of those restaurants where the servers intentionally curse you out | Thank you! Lugers sounds too fancy for me. I didn't see the option request rooms on their reservation site but will ask upon arrival and see if I get lucky. | I can only afford to go to one sadly :') Thank you! | I was if this was the case, since they lost their Michelin star. Thank you so much! | Thank you! Do you recommend that we order porter house for two get the T bone steak? | lol Lugers isn’t in a great neighborhood - that’s ridiculous. Go to Keens because it’s a quintessential NYC experience; but don’t not go to Lugers due to the neighborhood it’s in. | luger is like a 10 minute walk from the heart of Wburg. if anything the keen's location is worse because midtown. | Nick + Stefs was good the one time I went, ages ago. But I'd go to Keens every single time. Lunch is great there too. | Easier to bar hop in that location too. Close to K-town and the subways. | Oh in case you haven't seen [Anthony Bourdain talk about Keens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSKLeo6Mb3k&t=2s), it might help you decide. | Luger's actually isn't fancy -- it has kind of a German beer hall feel.  You don't need to be fancy to be expensive and rude!  On the plus side, nobody will bat an eye if you show up in sweats. | It’s not too fancy, its straight up stupid, catering to tourists who want to experience a “rude New Yorker.” They don’t accept credit card, they charge $15 for a plate if completely unexceptional onions and tomatoes, they mock peoples orders and call that “quirky”, nothing but the steak is any good. just dumb shitty service with a bad attitude. | You can call them during hours when they’re  open and ask them for that specific seating, they’ll add a note to your reservation. | It’s definitely not fancy, I go in jeans and a hoodie after work sometimes during lunch for the burger | The mutton chop is literally their signature dish. It's great (if you like lamb) | I had the T-bone, shared with with a friend with sides and that was enough for us. In terms of taste, not sure what's better. | If there’s two of you and you both prefer your steak the same way, porterhouse for two, the T-bone is just the smaller serving for one. 

Also full confession on one occasion me and my husband have demolished the Porterhouse for 3. Plus creamed spinach plus hash brown potatoes plus we ate all the celery sticks and pickles. We are not large people, it’s very good and we were hungry. | As someone who lives there, what exactly is in the heart of Williamsburg? | There's like three bars on every block of Bedford, starting about S 2nd, which is only 4 blocks away from Peter Luger. And bar after bar on Berry and on Driggs, too, leading all the way up to McCarren Park. Definitely more bars and better prices near Peter Luger than near Keens. It just feels a bit isolated because Peter Luger is on the other side of the Williamsburg Bridge, and you have to cross under to get to all those bars. | I'd rather bar hop near lugers | Peter Luger must have one of the world's best supply chains for produce because it's an absolute goddamn miracle that they can reliably get the world's worst winter tomatoes at the height of summer. | Bravo. The onions and tomato may be the most overpriced and underwhelming dish in the history of dining. It’s like charging $10 or $15 for a single Oreo cookie for dessert. Only saving grace is it’s actually funny when you think about it. | My understanding (I could be wrong) … is that it’s not actually mutton anymore, it’s a lamb chop, but it’s still good | Yeah. Im not saying that the Peter Luger’s area is devoid of bars or things to do. I just feel like Keens is much easier to access different bars from the sheer proximity of things. | You might call it elder lamb. The lamb is slaughtered later than it usually is, so it has more distinctive sheep’s meat flavor and is physically larger. It’s not truly mutton, which is fully mature if not elderly sheep. Neither is it typical restaurant lamb. 

If you’ve ever wanted lamb to taste MORE like lamb you’ll like it. If you’ve generally wanted lamb to taste milder, less like lamb, you won’t."

Is it possible to get bread from New York shipped all the way over here, and would it even be any good by the time it arrives? Really want some Kaiser rolls","Ship it unbaked

Also why ? There are lots of good bakeries in Tokyo | Might have better luck trying to convince a local baker to take up the challenge | Sure, you CAN ship it but if you're talking fresh bread you'd want to do the fastest delivery possible like 1-2days which will probably cost like $150. | Looks like it's possible to ship bread international according to [this link](https://www.shopnicepacks.com/blogs/news/how-to-ship-bread-the-ultimate-2024-guide), but certain types are more/less ideal than others.

I need Hot Chocolate reccs for the winter.,My girlfriend loves hot chocolate more than anything. She goes crazy for the stuff! I want to treat her to the best places to get it in NYC. Location is irrelevant. Prices are irrelevant. What's everybody's favorite spots? And why? I plan to compile a list and take her to all the best ones. ,"The carboholic on IG has an excel sheet with rankings for every hot chocolate place in the city. | MarieBelle in SoHo, they use really good chocolate instead of cocoa powder or syrup | Burdick’s in SoHo. Made with ground dark chocolate (not cocoa), this has a very intense chocolate flavor. The first time I got it I couldn’t finish it because I wasn’t prepared for the intensity but it set a craving for more. Also if you can find it, Jacques Torres, there might still be one in Grand Central | mariebelle is mine. maybe cafe angelina, too? | I like Venchi’s hot chocolate a lot. One of the best imo, but you get it in a paper cup to go so you’re not sitting in a cozy ambiance to sip it out of a mug or anything. | Best I’ve had lately is from Sugar Hill Creamery. It’s rich and dark and topped with torched marshmallow fluff. | Lysee has a non-dairy hot chocolate that is better than any regular hot chocolate. Bonus the bakery is great too | Surprised nobody has said bar pisellino but theirs is fantastic | Not traditional hot chocolate, but Blue Stripes Cacao Shop near Union Square has been a fun one for me. Apparently now called ""[Stripes Wine Bar & Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UUXXPtnjDQUTYvqu9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy)"", looks looks like they still have the chocolate cafe menu. | Some recommendations from a few days ago: [Best Hot Chocolate in each borough?](https://reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gp3juv/best_hot_chocolate_in_each_borough/) | Check out the winter village in Bryant park. Lots of hot cocoa stands there right now. | La Maison Du Chocolat in Rockefeller Center serves a nice cup. Nice shop to warm up after visiting the tree. | Second reco for LA Burdick - but that’s a “real” hot chocolate - as in very thick and rich. For a “fun” experience - they just opened up Bryant park Christmas village and I love getting hot chocolate there with marshmallows and strolling through the village looking at the ice skaters. | Fabrique! One of the best I’ve ever had. I personally thought Mariebelle’s was too thick. | The Chocolate Room in Cobble Hill | Glacé on the UES, Frenchette Bakery in Tribeca, Davey’s Ice Cream in the east village or Moynihan, Rigor Hill Market in Tribeca, Butterfield Market on the UES | I’m checking out every single place on this list through the season you guys are great, but as a lactose person, I’ll eat an entire box of pills to drink the biggest Max Brenner thick Italian hot chocolate I can get my hands on.. like a slice of cake poured directly into a cup and into my veins | Op I don’t have recs but this is incredibly wholesome of you to make a list like this💟 | Chocolate room cobble hill

Jacques Torres 

Frozen hot chocolate 

I used to love the one @ Vosges but they closed. | Jacque Torres is the best | Cafe ix by the prospect park Q stop! Multiple types and the owners are Guatemalan so it’s very traditional preparation. Great cafe for lunch too | Max Brenner peanut butter hot chocolate. Thank me later | I humbly suggest Max Brenner’s at Union St. I had their Fall special pumpkin spice hot chocolate recently and really enjoyed it :) The pumpkin spice is mostly on top, and the rest is just regular hot chocolate. | Serendipity 3 is a big tourist trap with a bs spend minimum but their drinks are actually worth the hype. Technically I think their signature hot chocolate is frozen drink.

Also bonus points for it being a cute instagrammable spot. Fish tacos were solid if you were to get food. | Santa Chiara in LIC makes incredible hot chocolate. They chop up bars of chocolate to make it | I have been waiting for this moment since I had Thai Diner’s hot chocolate… I would order three at a time if that were socially acceptable 😭😭😭 what is that cream they put on top!!! GODDDDD | no chewing allowed! they have stands at the holiday market in bryant park and union square | Wherever Maury Rubin pops up. I think he’s still planning his NYC dates. IG: _colorofchocolate_ (with underscores before and after “colorofchocolate”; sorry I don’t know how to format on mobile) 

Just tried the hot cocoa at Breads Bakery the other day (Rockefeller location), and it was lovely. It’s very dark, rich and thick, if she likes that style. They serve it with a mini palmier cookie and optional toasted marshmallow. 

If you guys like MarieBelle, I recommend returning in the summer to get their iced chocolate. It’s so good. | Angelina’s near Bryant Park is pretty world famous for their sipping chocolate | I’ve been using The Carbaholic IG account for a hot chocolate reference, but this year I’ve tried and personally enjoyed: 

- Blossoming Hot Chocolate from Dominique Ansel (overpriced imo) 

- Hazelnut Hot Chocolate from Venchi’s 

- Bread’s Bakery Hot Chocolate (I feel like they changed their process for making it though; it tasted a lot better last year) 

- FanFan Doughnut’s Hot Chocolate (this one’s out in Brooklyn) 

- Davey’s Ice Cream Hot Chocolate 

- Rigor Hill’s Hot Chocolate (Carbaholic ranked this one high, but it’s overpriced and overrated in my opinion) 

- Max Brenner’s Italian Thick Hot Chocolate 

- Caffe Panna served a decent seasonal hot chocolate last year. 


Still yet to try Frenchette Bakery. | Ground Support in Soho has incredible hot chocolate. | Hi, just chiming in that it’s also super easy to make amazing hot chocolate at home with the right, high quality ingredients!

Both the spicy and regular versions of their hot chocolate use real chocolate rather than cocoa powder; it’s thick as hell and so good.

Texture sucked | Seconding this - had it last winter and it was soooo delish | I think they make it with ice cream instead of milk which is amazing.

And a bunch of bonbons to go! | Rigor hill i thought was terrible. Couldn’t get thru it and pitched it out. Cloyingly sweet. The actual hot chocolate part from glace was good, but those whipped rims can be too much after a little | Yeah, it depends upon how you like your hot chocolate. | Haven't tried theirs yet probably grab one on my way to work on tuesday. Ultimate Chocolate shop had an interesting take on it. | How was Ultimate Chocolate? What was the interesting take they had? I haven't had their hot chocolate yet. | They were pretty pricey so I wouldn't really recommend it but they torched marshmallows on top of the hot chocolate before putting whipped cream and some chocolate sprinkles.
In addition I'm not sure about german hot chocolate but it was more of a bittersweet hot chocolate. If you look at it like a regular hot chocolate you might be a bit disappointed but if you don't mind the bitterness which naturally comes from chocolate, it's not so bad. | Ahh ok.

Pretty sure that Persian cuisine features bread made this way. | Yeah, we need em fresh out of the tandoori | I would sadly have to agree about the bread. It’s worth noting that the Uzbek people traditionally had a nomadic lifestyle so their food had to be durable, easy to carry and have a long shelf life.

There are other Uzbek dishes worth trying out though, especially in south Brooklyn around Brighton Beach.

It looks amazing though. | The ones I saw at tashkent were packaged and looked mediocre. Tashkent is good for convenience but the really good atuff is the restaurants around the area | Nargis for sure. Also excellent cheburek and plov | Side note, I remember trying an Uzbek plov at this place and the rice wasn’t bad but the beef they served it was so dry, hard and bland that I really questioned trying Uzbek food ever again. | Persian bread is not similar to this bread. | It's been a little bit since I had it, but I vaguely remember it somehow being salty but also having that vacuous white flour taste, similar to Florentine bread. It also had a strong flavor of baking powder. | Good to know | those are called non toki.

Also, this place is shomer shabbos. Closed Saturdays. | Nor is pide. | I have to second this. The Uzbek and Bukharian bread I’ve had in Rego Park and Brighton Beach has been overly salty and overly floury tasting… and I’m someone who loves almost any kind of freshly baked bread. | Yes!  And I'm pretty sure cash only. | Yeah, it's salty and tends towards dry."
The only booth at the holiday markets that I need. Yes it's tourist-priced and no I don't care,,"I need them to scoop it directly into my mouth thx | The prices are fucking insane but I fucking love that place! | What if I told you you can buy a raclette heater thing at Murray's Cheese for about $40? | That is easily my favorite stand foodwise at winter village, that and the hot chocolate from No chewing allowed. I literally went to the raclette stand about an hour ago lol. | Next time youre there, go to Joey Bats and get some pasteis de nata (custard tarts) as dessert.  I think eating them in the cold makes them taste even better | It’s wildddd how bad this stuff smells. | Good for you.  Fuck any douche that calls out the occasional visit/patronage to holiday markets, street fairs, San Gennaro, etc.  They probably just spent $300 on dinner for 2 at some place they didn’t even like but were told to go to. | which one is the best one? | omg its at Bryant park. i pass there every day im going tomorrow | I miss the restaurant😭 loved having small bday dinners there with my friends. Globs of yummy cheese in January was just 🙌🏾 | Next time I go back for that hot chocolate from
No chewing allowed I’m stopping by here first 😤 thank you for reminding me about this stinky good cheese | Is this currently open? I’m coming to visit in a few weeks and it’s been showing as temporarily closed on google for at least the last month or so. | Fuck yes. | I remember going there Christmas Eve, years ago. Pre-pandemic. Most packed I ever saw Bryant Park. I was in line and they ran out of cheese right before I could get mine. I carry that disappointment to this day. 🧀 | [https://bakedcheesehaus.com/](https://bakedcheesehaus.com/)

[https://www.yelp.com/biz/baked-cheese-haus-new-york](https://www.yelp.com/biz/baked-cheese-haus-new-york) | I'm super disappointed that they use bread instead of potatoes | I was wondering if it was worth the hype, thank you! | I have a friend visiting the city in December with his girlfriend who has never been to NY.

Are any of the holiday markets actually good? She wants to visit one. I assume Bryant Park is the iconic one? I've never really gone to any of them. | I missed it last year but it was still on google maps. So disappointed when I got there and it was no longer around. Thanks for the reminder | If you get a chance, ""The Truffliest"" cheesesteaks are FIIIIIRE. It's NYC/Tourist/Bryant park prices but it will treat you right. | If you crave it a lot and don't want to pay the prices, you can also get a home raclette grill set up; I saw it for the first time when I was visiting my friends in Bruxelles. Kind of like the electric KBBQ grills but with a heating element that aims down onto cheese in trays.

That way you can choose the cheeses and other stuff you want to top with it! | Going mid December. I'll stop by and try it | That place stinks so bad. We thought there were dead animals under the building. | I wish they always had the traditional raclette. (The one with potatoes instead of bread) | This makes me want to get a big plate of tteokbokki (spicy Korean rice cakes) and have them just put all that melty cheese on top. 😬 | Haven’t bought anything there but the consensus is good. I’ll pay a visit here | Take my money | Yuck that place smells so bad | How many of us said “Bet it‘s the cheese haus” before we clicked | You can get a home raclette grill! It's a different setup - uses cheese slices rather than half wheel. Just have to manage the stinky cheese odor. | I got one of these last year and it tasted like the sole of a foot | You do what you got to do for yourself. | Our cats are obsessed with the catnip candy cane plushies from the cat toy vendor in Union Square.

It's also tourist prices but they still go crazy over them. | I love these! I'm also severely lactose intolerant. I have to take like 5 lactaid pills to eat one or I suffer severe consequences. But its worth it. LOL | The price is insane but I love it and Idc, the chocolate babka, I could eat one every day | Where? | byant park? | It’s so so good. | Hit 60 degrees today tho, maybe later. | The pickle place is great too! | Need more toasty | Every time I’ve tried going, the line has been BONKERS | I tried to look for it at the Union square one right now and couldn’t find it!! Which booths is it next to? | in love with the OP's complete lack of shame about paying tourist prices for melty cheese. kudos. | Try working right by it and having the resit the urge most days from November to March | Damn you, my lactose intolerance seems to have subsided again so that, and seeing this post means I’ll be spending like I’m a tourist sometime this next week for lunch. | Yooo which market??? | Quality went down about as fast as the price went up. I used to go to this place and love the $12 raclette sandwich I'd get. Now it's $18 bread sucked balls, the pickles are missing, the mustard is nowhere to be found. They used to take orders as they produce but now they make you wait a good 30 mins after you paid to get your sandwich which literally takes about 20s and $3 to make. I went for the last time this year, after so many years of enjoyment. Social media and influencers killed another nice thing. Fuck you | That’ll probably kill me, but now I want one too. $20 for a quick, undignified exit. Seems like a deal to me! | Enjoy it because in a month the line for that place will be practically in NJ 🤦‍♀️ | always found it odd for them to be selling it in Smorgasburg in the middle of July | Is this cheese flavorful or mild? | [deleted] | Honestly one of the worst things I've smelled in Manhattan and that's saying something. It tastes pretty good though. | Raclette smells funny to me but to each their own. My wife loves it too. | Wear is the place at | Why so traditional only 1$ less lol | The smell is way too strong for me. | This stand is the most offensive at the holiday market. It stinks | I remember paying like €6-8 at the markets in Germany last year. Paying $20 takes away all the fun. | Really? I’ve never wanted it. The wheels just out there all day lol | I hope it tastes better than it looks | Love this | Can I volunteer? | Gonna burn the roof of your mouth ;P | Yeah, for me it’s like Lucy’s sausage at the Feast of San Gennaro. Sure, it’s overpriced, but I always get it once or twice a year when it comes. | Fuck! | Your neighbors will revolt | I’m guessing even cheaper on Amazon. | Yesss the hot chocolate! It's a non-negotiable every time I go to the winter village. | Hmm I tried them last time but prefer Lisbonata in Brooklyn! | Shit you damn people are determined to make me fat(er). | Those chocolate ones are insanely delicious! | I wished I liked them but they’re way too sweet | Nice Portuguese! | Okay, but is there a place in the city to get Bifanas? I had them hungover one day in Lisbon, and I’ve been chasing that ever since. So good… | I know! I went to look at the egg tarts and was like wtf is that stench and this cheese stand was next door lol | As someone who typically loves (very good) stinky French cheeses, I think this place smells absolutely repulsive. | So bad! If you're downwind from the stand, watch out! | It makes the whole area smell like hot garbage it’s so bad. | What does it say about me that I think it smells good 😭 | I don't mind it on its own (because contextualizing it works for me!) but if I'm eating anything else I have to stay faaaarrr away or it kind of ruins whatever I'm trying to eat. | My cousin calls it “pee pee trash cheese” 😂 | Yeah man it's ok to eat mainstream. Not every meal needs to be in an underground kitchen operated by a 90 year old first generation granny from Nepal who has never even heard of the health department. Those places are great but mainstream places can make good food too. | why don't we let everyone in NYC enjoy their overpriced food experiences, whether it's a touristy food fair or an overhyped restaurant | For real. My parents moved out of state in the last couple years but my dad is always calling me like ""yo bring ya ass down to feast of San Gennaro and overnight me some shit"" because I guess he was surprised (??) that the south doesn't have any Italian food. And you bet your ass that I'm enjoying the feast too, no shame in that game | Winter Village is pretty nice. I bought some playing cards with dogs on the back there. | The Jamon is my favorite. We have Kindlemarkets in Chicago, and this is my must-have every year. | See you there. | Agreed, l loved the restaurant  and miss it, too. | The Bryant Park is open. My friend went Sunday. He was like “I know it’s an insane price but it’s just soooo good” 😁 | Had it just today at Bryant Park! Dunno if Union Square or Columbus Circle are up yet. | Iirc they have a separate booth for the potatoes. | Yeah, Bryant Park is the biggie and I think it's a fun time. I was being hyperbolic when I said this was the only booth I cared about, there are several neat ones there, the skating rink, etc. Definitely bring your friends there | Columbus circle is small but has my favorite scarf maker, Peter Charles savvy. 

Union square is also great but pickpockety so keep your stuff in sealable or interior pockets. | They’re fun if you go in with fair expectations. Bryant Park’s nice because it’s nearby a lot of other sites out-of-towners enjoy, and it has the carousel which is always popular. 

I pick up truffle tins from No Chewing Allowed to gift friends and family for the holidays, and they’re always a hit. Also recommend stopping by Aux Merveilleux de Fred on 37th/6th Ave if they like sweets. The merveilleux always feel festive. | I got food poisoning from them a couple weeks ago. Now when I think about or smell truffles, I get nauseous. | Not as fun! | That's remarkable! You got any other tidbits about yourself that are totally unrelated to the post you'd like to share? | For what it's worth, there were only like five people in front of me when I went yesterday around 1 pm. | Try Bryant Park—I can guarantee it’s at that one. | I am pretty sure you get norovirus from people not from sandwiches. It’s extremely contagious. | It definitely tastes better than it smells. | And then what? 😳🥵 | Great stuff - and yes pricey, however, their meals keep one so satiated, fulfilled, and cozy. :) | lol saw your headline here and was like “no way, whatever it is is wrong, the only booth that matters is the raclette booth… oh… good” | That's fuckin right! | To be fair, you don’t have to use it just for raclette/other smelly cheeses. My parents got a raclette grill when I was a kid, and most of the time, we melted Monterey Jack when we used it because it’s cheaper and my dad doesn’t like funky cheeses. | Make sure to smoke some dank beforehand for that extra door-banging touch! | Same the Joey Bats custard tasted goey? Like not the right consistency. I loved Lisbonata though | Admittedly I don’t like cheese at all and parmesan smells like vomit to me, but this…is on another level. First time I walked by I was shocked no one else seemed to notice. | I also love some rather adventurous blue cheese, but can’t get within 50 feet of this stand. Absolutely awful. I think I’d rather be on an airplane with someone eating durian. | One gets called out far more than the other.  Whole reason for my comment.  Its probably the reason OP felt the need to use that title. | yes, good to keep the tourists happy about their NYC experience. we need/love their money. lol. | Union Square is up, I saw it yesterday. I just don’t know if it’s open yet. | Oh that makes me so happy to hear! Thank you. | Union Square opens tomorrow. | Where is it? I looked because they did last year, but I couldn't find it | Union square is also huge, but pickpockety so keep your stuff in coat pockets. 

Columbus circle has my favorite scarf maker, Peter Charles savvy. | I looked them up on Yelp and there were so many food poisoning reviews. Definitely some unsafe food handling practices there lol | Thank you so much! Doing the lord’s work | Third degree burn. Ouch! | I am not a fan of Joey’s texture.too sweet and “goey”. | What is the texture of Lisbonata's custard? More firm? | Not trying to be rude here but if you literally hate all cheese then why are you even commenting lol | Yeah, the last time I posted about San Gennaro most of the comments were about how overpriced it was, and for certain items I just do not give a *fuck* | almost every post where someone talks about a trendy restaurant has some comment about how it's not worth it and go find your local spots. it's just low effort commenting from everyone criticizing things that they're not going to do! | Nah it's open today | Oh I was speaking from previous years experience. That’s weird if they didn’t bring it back! | Idk how to explain exactly but it’s just less goopy/sticky texture and more what the ones in Portugal are like | Lisbonata is way more custardy and creamy! Joey bats is like more gooey and jelly like. It’s like how some flans are creamy and some are more jelly like. | I like cheese but think this stuff is putrid smelling. To each their own | Haha a very fair point and no offense taken. Ultimately it just cracks up me how seemingly popular this particular thing is. | Yeah idk what we’re going back and forth about. 

Just don’t be a pretentious knob people.  That’s my message, I’m sticking to it. | Nice. That's ahead of the published schedule. | Maybe when Union square gets set up? | I thought the opposite actually, maybe they had an off day but when I tried them the inside was almost liquid, it dripped all down my T-shirt. I got both the original and the pistachio and both were liquidy. That being said the taste was spot on. | Mine was definitely not like that at all! I wonder maybe if it gets gooey and firm when overcooked?"
"Seared Spanish mackerel topped with uni at SSAW, Brooklyn","Had terrific kaiseki with a delicious sake pairing at SSAW last evening. This sashimi dish also featured a ponzu jelly. There are a few others I loved but my photos wouldn't do them justice, such as the deep fried sweet fish with a shaved black truffle supplement, unagi in dashi broth, barracuda clay pot rice, and fig ice cream. Everyone was so friendly. I would highly recommend!","Photos from SSAW's latest tasting menu are on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ssaw.brooklyn), including: wagyu beef tongue, mushroom tofu, conger eel and turnip"
Trip to NYC in December:,"My husband and I go to NYC twice a year and every time we go we try new food places. We have our staples, but we are looking for a new pizza place to try (crown heights pizza is our usual go to) and anything else you think is the best and worth a visit. We don’t care where it is, we will subway/uber/walk to wherever and we love all foods so anything goes! ","There are over 23,000 restaurants here. How on earth is anyone supposed to answer a question as vague and generic as ""Where should we eat?"" | Crown heights pizza is a wild choice, isn’t even the best pizza in a one block radius lol | L & B Spumoni Gardens | I like Kesté for pizza, L'Antica Pizzaria da Michele or Rubirosa, impossible to get a reservation but you could try.

If you are looking for something different, I recommend Çka Ka Qëllue, Albanian food, their bread is to die for, everything is great, ABA Turkish is good too, Dim Sum Palace for Cantonese food, very tasty and fresh, they have a few restaurants around the city, I particularly like going to the East Village one. 

Chain restaurants I like Carmines for Italian, Empanada Mama (Hells kitchen location). | Pretty sure there’s a dominoes on Montgomery St…  

How in the world is crown heights pizza your go to slice shop? | Rubirosa is great and you might be able to walk in for lunch. Stretch Pizza in Madison Park is run by Chef Wylie Dufresne and is doing some amazing things; well worth checking out because you won’t find this at home | Denino's or Joe & Pat's both have phenomenal pizza. | I’ll make it easy, go grab some L’industrie | Rubirosa | Lots of people say L’Industrie (but only their Bklyn location) is outstanding but I have heard it said that Joe and Pat’s in Staten Island might be the best pizza in the city. And I just stumbled across a place on Instagram called G&R Deli in the Bronx serving up something they call the Italian Ice Cream Cone which is essentially a meatball parm hero reinvented and it looks like it’d be worth the trip. Enjoy. | I’m looking for suggestions of places you would go on a regular day that you enjoy and frequent, it’s fairly easy lol | We found it when we stayed there the one time since it was the closest to us lol we really only get their granny style pizza, it’s my husbands preferred style 😂 | Thank you! I added it to our list to check out! | Thank you so much!! 
We love ABA! We go to Turkey a lot for trips and their food is like being back there! I’ll definitely add the Albanian and Cantonese place to our list as well to try out ❤️ | 😂😂 it’s my husbands, he loves their granny style lol | Does it matter which location? I heard Christopher street isn’t as good but I haven’t been to either. | I just told my husband about that deli and he’s already looking at our schedule to see where we can fit it in😂 | > it’s fairly easy lol

Girl, go google it then. There’s still thousands of restaurants. This is a lazy request. Provide some specific information about what you’re looking for and you’ll get a better response. | Tough crowd | Honestly fair, there aren’t a ton of good grandma slices in the immediate vicinity, I think overall tho Crown Heights Pizza is just meh

La Flor is a better slice shop even with its smaller menu, Barboncino is personal ish pizzas so different style but very good, and Brooklyn Pizza Crew is only a short walk away and also just better than Crown Heights Pizza in nearly every regard. CHP just gets the edge for menu size imo | You're welcome! ☺️ | Christopher street was great. At first I was like “wow this line is so stupid for a slice of pizza I can get down the street” but it was worth it imho | I hope it’s as good as it looks! | lol yea we weren’t overly in love with the regular slices, but the granny style was decent- I’ll definitely check out the other places, we really just go to nyc to eat good food we can’t get here (I’m still NY, but near Buffalo) | I’ll definitely report back in a few weeks lol | Buffalo is a great junk food city but really misses out on a pizza scene (I went to college there before I came back down here) 

Franco’s was I think my favorite pizza place, any place in Buffalo that tried to mimic NYC style round pies was garbage but I did enjoy a good Franco’s square once in a blue moon"
"Cool, modern interior for a Solo diner on a Saturday Night","turn out I am going to be in Manhattan next Saturday, and am thinking about where to eat. I know this is not the usual criteria to choose a restaurant, but I really want to find a place with a cool modern interior (something I can't find near where I live). I will be dining by myself, if that helps or hurts. I am completely comfortable just sitting at a table by myself. The problems I have are: I can't go above midrange (say $50, without drinks); I don't do seafood; I don't do South Asian. I will be staying midtown area somewhere, but willing to travel a bit. I would prefer to stay in Manhattan, though.","Empellón at 53rd and Madison. You can eat for $50, it’s a super modern interior, fantastic food (one of the best in NYC), and in Midtown.

"Italian below 23rd street with great food, not noisy with round tables","Hi,

Our Big Boss is coming from LA to wine & dine us. There's 5 of us. A couple of years ago we went to Scalinatella and had a blast. This year my local boss wants an Italian restaurant below 23rd street. Priorities are great food, interesting/fun vibe, not too noisy & round tables. Please advise. Thanks!","The round tables is actually a more difficult ask than you'd think. [Torrisi](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/torrisi-new-york-2?select=WnwsJeb7ksQpitai1lk22w) has them, but good luck getting a resy there. 

What about [Locanda Verde](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/locanda-verde-new-york-6?select=Nnu1sGrdeMpKoQ8toLK9xg)? | LMAO I feel like a salesperson bc I keep recommending them but Zero Otto Nove is what you want! Good ambiance, great italian, you can hear each other speak, it’s below 23rd, and there are round tables for that size group though maybe worth calling to confirm you get placed at a round table. | Il Cantinori on 10th | Il Cantinori

John's of 12th St | Il posto accanto in EV is a very good local spot. won't be noisy and the owner is super nice and quirky. No round tables though as far as I know | Da Umberto. Not sure about the round table but it hits o/w. | I have sat at a big round table at Bar Primi. It’s pretty good, better downtown Italian options exist but a lot of them may be tighter on space. | Altro Paradiso | I love Portale! Great pasta and a solid wine list. It’s my fav Italian place for big group dinners when fam / friends visit us...they have some round tables that seat 6+ and it’s not very noisy | Anton’s has round tables | Carne Mare is an Italian steakhouse in Seaport, reserve one of the round booths upstairs. Great food and atmosphere. | One Fifth. They have round tables, and it’s a big restaurant that isn’t too sceney so doesn’t get too loud. And they’ll have availability unlike half the recs here which are just a list of impossible reservations like Torisi and Don Angi. | Pepolino near the Roxy hotel | Pretty sure Scalini Fedeli (underrated IMO) has some round tables! | Morandi | Idk about round tables but John’s of 12th is solid | Saint Theo’s is amazing | Nonna Beppa? | da Umberto | Don Angie has a big round table inside I’ve sat at for a work dinner. Have fun! | I think Rezdora has a couple of round tables (call to make sure). It's seriously good Northern Italian food. | Supper would be my recommendation except for the round tables. They have a good space for groups though | Scarpetta. Morandi. Don Angie. Dante. I sodi. No idea about round tables. Hearth. L’artusi. | Osteria Nonnino

Sant Ambroeus at brookfield

Lupa

cipriani downtown | Emilio’s Ballato on Houston | Locanda great but it's never not noisey for dinner.

Basically, Italian is the most popular cuisine in NYC, and the best Italian restaurants downtown are all jammed all the time. This is a hard rec if you really wanna try the ""best"" - also clarify whether you want Italian American (Emilio Ballato, John's of 12th, Don Angie) or more traditional italian (locanda verde, Hearth, Pasquale jones, torrissi, via carota, Il Buco, ci  siamo). 

The smaller restaurants will be less noisy? But all of them Are jumping, and due to price point, the tables are packed together (you have to do big numbers with smaller check averages). 

I'd say ci siamo, or Borgo, just opened, so not jammed yet. Beautiful room. But that's very traditional, and not quite as mass-appeal As some of the others. | Torrisi: round tables but not interested in our reservation. 

Locanda: no round tables in online pics

thanks all the same | Seconding zero otto. Have been to the arthur ave location multiple times and am never disappointed | I went a few years ago and didn't care for it. But it probably fits your desires. | The old Oto space. Close to Local Boss's apartment so she doesn't have to worry about getting home after 2nd bottle of wine.

Thanks again Burnsy. | Rezdora is great for pasta, but so small I don't know if they have more than one table to fit 5-6. But good call. Also it's quite loud as it's a railroad alley type space . | That restaurant is loud as hell, doesn’t fit the ask | Half of those are impossible recommendations and half are super loud downtown sceney spots | Il buco/il buco alimentari are great | Thanks for conscientious response that's a good read. 

Round tables, great food, vibe, below 23rd Street: equivalent priorities  All deal breakers.

Authentic vs Fahgettaboutit Eyetalian: Not sophisticated enough in that regard to be issue 

Carota: We were considering. It's a recommendation that keeps coming up. But no round tables.

Ballato: I remember their cesear salad with affection. Plus the starf\*cker vibe can be fun if you're in the mood for that. 

Torrisi: reservation robot scoffed in my face.

Il Bucco: yeah maybe time to go back and flashback to some 90's entanglements

John's: 30 years ago my all-time favorite girlfriend told me they kicked David Wojnarowicz out for having AIDS. True or not, I always believed anything she told me. | Adding that pre pandemic, you could spend up, and go to del posto or marea and have unreal food experience (if money ain't a thing), and for the money, you get space and peace. But marea lost a step without Michael white, and del posto (rip batali restaurants, and good riddance) he had great people (Mel and Ladner, but sadly they were both kind of victims of the groups fall from grace). | Look at their pics on Yelp. Locanda definitely has some round tables: https://yelp.to/zuCe2Yy4Eq | Was about to jump on here and recommend Zero Otto. | thanks again burns. A longtime fan of Franks and Little Frankies so I did consider it. But, yeah, noisy & no round tables are deal breakers. | Thanks for your vigilance | still haunted by the fried egg pizza at oto. Did a deep dive on that last month because someday I'll try to recreate it. By the way, its Sardinian origin. | Supper does have a great private room that you can book. Feels speakeasy ish because you have to walk through their wine storage to access and your group has a private bathroom.  Another nice touch is that you control the music for your space. I have done two events in this space and both were great!  (No round table but definitely a good time)"
AMA; Help me pick places for sat/sunday,"Came to nyc for a 10 day food trip for a friends bachelor party. He is leaving the country and getting married and as he loves nyc we decided to this. 
I agree there are a lot of hype-ish places but that’s because he was leaving and might not be back for a long time. 
Biggest upsets: una and bungalow. 
Unexpected find: soup dumplings, tea at Nan Xiang. 
Hoping lucali is will save its name once again. Loved it last time. 
Scars still my favorite pizza!!

AMA anything about the places I have been to and help me fill the slots for Saturday and Sunday. ","The audacity to conduct an AMA as a tourist and ask for advice in the same breath | You’re cross crossing the whole city multiple times without making consecutive stops for great places nearby your destination. I’d break it into neighborhoods and have multiple meals in one area. | I’d go to Radio bakery on Sunday. It’s easily the best bakery I’ve been to. They have both sweet and savory options and if you go with a group you can try a lot of stuff on their menu

Saturday dinner might be tough without a rez. I noticed you didn’t have any ~best burger in the city~ places yet so it might be worth it to head to red hook tavern and try to wait in line for a 5pm table. Can also try getting a bar seat at Minetta Tavern | If you're doing Katz/Noodle Bar (I assume) on Saturday, some of my favorites in the rough area:

* Carnitas Ramirez - My favorite tacos, at least stop in and get a surtida.
* Just about everything on the first block of St. Marks.  If you really liked soup dumplings you can hit the trifecta and go to: The Bao, Nan Xiang and CheLi (CheLi is my favorite these days).  Also Szechuan Mountain House, 886, Mamouns, Bead Papas, Xing Fu Tang (they will ruin you for tapioca from any other bubble tea shop), Barcade for an ok beer selection (proletariat for a great one), 
* Cafe Mogador for a 40 year old EV staple
* TabeTomo (reopened!) for my favorite ramen in the city (tonktosu tsukemen just makes me happy).
* Hekate - alcohol free bar/coffee shop with a lot of house made syrups and tea blends (I get a coffee w/ a syrup), lovely place to just sit and relax and digest.
* Superiority Burger - Expensive but good veg/vegan food.
* Veniero's for old school Italian American pastries.


and that's barely scratching the surface between those two places. | Luigis is so mid. look up Brooklyn DOP or L'arte Della Pizza Brooklyn or Pino's La Forchetta Pizza | This excel is from the time we planned. We have been trying to look up and go to nearby neighborhood places we love food hopping trying a couple of things and bouncing. This sadly doesn’t show all the random places we went like urban backyard for cupcakes and red gate for banana bread | Thanks will have to go to radio bakery now. Yes we are group of 4 with huge appetite! Thanks for the burger recommendations don’t mind waiting in line as am prepping to be in line for lucali I some time. | Horrible take. It's a perfect old school NY-style slice. | I’ll try those places but I have to disagree Luigi’s was refreshingly good in this day and age where every new pizzeria wants to make crispy pies! | Just fyi red hook is far from Manhattan and not accessible by subway (most people usually take the ferry) but there are some cool spots there (strong rope brewery, Sunny’s) so it’s easy to make an afternoon out of it

For Red Hook Tavern I’d line up around 415 to ensure you get a table

Also I’d watch the Action Bronson First We Feast video on YouTube about red hook tavern to build up some hype | i stand on it. its good basic zip code pizza. (if you live in the zip code). not worth it if you are coming from manhattan or a far away place. far better options out there. but if you are going to eat there just to say you ate there, then have at it."
Vegetarian spots in flushing ,"Hello, looking for recommendations in downtown flushing for a sit down vegetarian food-breakfast or brunch time. Cheese and eggs are fine,just no meat and seafood. ","What kinds of food are you looking for?

-	Ok Ryan (Taiwanese breakfast eg clay oven roll with egg, hot soy milk, egg baked cake with corn)
-	Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao (veggie options like dumplings)
-	Bodhi Village (all vegetarian) - a little further
-	Temple Canteen (all vegetarian) - a little further | Spring Shabu Shabu has vegetarian hotpot options. | Thank you! I’m looking for something local to flushing. Your recs sounds good. By temple canteen dk you mean the hindu temple canteen? | Yup that’s the one!

I’m visiting NYC soon and staying at a hotel in Brooklyn’s northernmost Greenpoint neighborhood, just off the East River. After some research, I’ve compiled a list of restaurants I’m considering for family dinners. I’d love to narrow it down and make the most of our meals together.



I’m primarily looking for dinner spots with seating, ideally located in Brooklyn. That said, if you have recommendations for must-visit restaurants outside Brooklyn, I’m open to exploring, as long as it’s not too far of a journey. My family and I love to get around and try new things!



Here’s my list so far:



* **Hometown BBQ**
* **Karczma**
* **Pierozek**
* **Theo Thai Bistro**
* **Al di La Trattoria**
* **San Marzano**
* **Via Trenta Osteria**
* **Manetta’s**
* **Ugly baby**
* **Forma Pasta Factory**
* **The Bedford**
* **Frankel’s Deli - Brekfast**
* **Little Bites Cafe - Breakfast** 
* **Taqueria Ramirez**



I feel like the list might be missing something, so I’d really appreciate any additional recommendations or feedback. We’re open to all cuisines—American, pub fare, Mexican, Polish, Asian, Italian, breakfast delis—you name it!

Thank you so much for your help!



","This is going to highly depend on which neighborhoods you’re planning on being in outside of meals. Hometown BBQ in Red Hook isn’t close to most things and isn’t straightforward to get to, so I wouldn’t try to head there from Greenpoint or midtown or Coney Island or the West Village or wherever you will be before dinner time or lunchtime. | Try to get in to Lillia or Misi for pasta. Better than most Italian in US, if you're in Greenpoint, you have to go to Ramirez, go for lunch on a weekday to beat the line.

Pizza, go to Lucali, if you can wait. Or F and F if you just wanna try a great slice. DiFara out in midwood BK legendary, but a schlep. L'industire in willamsburg is also really special.

A lot of your list for me is not so special as much as maybe buzzing right now. Buzz is dangerous, as everyone wants to eat somewhere NEW that doesn't mean it's all that good, or will stand the test of time.

Also so many of the best restaurants are very hard to get prime reservations. Start asap. Lock in some good ones. 

Cosme is fine dining Mexican, it's amazing. But in Greenpoint you also have Oxomoco, which is very good and less expensive.

You should do Dim Sum in flushing or at golden unicorn in Chinatown. Just a real unique experience for anyone that's not been to china, or SF.

If you like Thai, you could go to Ayada or sripapapi in queens, or Thai diner, SEA (Manhattan) or ugly baby in BK

Hometown is the only bbq worth out of town visitors. It's special but yeah a real hike from green point. Unless Ubers aren't a problem(but that's like a 80 dollar Uber I bet)

Raouls is an amazing classic NY gem. Go back to the 80s in that room. Steak au poive is top tier. 


There are so many good restaurants. So many that have been around for years but no one writes about them bc food media is just chasing novelty these days. Talk to more people, and listen to locals (I'm a native New Yorker and a chef )

If you have a specific q about a certain cuisine - add price point and that's helpful. I'd give more recs. But I already gave you some gems that are less talked about these days, but better than a lot of the restaurants with more buzz - the classics are always jammed, so they don't need / look for PR anymore. | I live in greenpoint.  Would skip forma, never been but you can do much better with Italian in the area like naked dog imo. 

Also fyi you'll be on the subway for about 45 mins going to ugly baby.  Ubers are expensive AF here, as is mostly everything. And as others said you should add wayy more queens. Greenpoint is close to LIC, Astoria and even Elmhurst. Could easily walk across the bridge and catch the 7 to flushing.


Just enjoy your time and don't try to make it perfect. NYC is very unforgiving and best experienced on a whim imo.  The best things here happen when you aren't trying too hard. | I live in the neighborhood and your list is off to a good start but needs some tweaking. Either Karczma or Pierozeck but not both. Al Di La and Ugly Baby can be skipped, IMO. Both decent but I’d pass if you have limited time. Minetta’s is a tough resy and a bit overrated. If it’s a burger you’re better off at Peter Lugers for lunch or Rolo’s (I prefer Rolo’s but also a tough resy and only 25 burgers a night so a 5-6pm dinner). DM me if you want more specifics. Hope you have a good time here! | You’re going to be pretty close to one of my favourite restaurants in NYC, M Wells in LIC (sadly closing at the end of the year). Easy to book, amazing food, tho a bit on the exxy side. In Greenpoint Wen Wen is great Taiwanese. Also as people have said, go to Queens, you can get the G train to court square and pick up the 7. | If you're already going to be East Village/Soho area, then San Marzano is alright but I would not make the trek there. It's nothing special and a lot of college kids/younger adults dine there.

Forma Pasta is also nothing special. It's nice and a decent price point but you are basically fighting for a table since it's a first come-first serve basis. For Italian, I definitely recommend LaRina Pastifico & Vino. Their Tagliolini alle Vongole is amazing and making an reservation should be easy atleast a week a head of time.

If you're staying in Greenpoint there are great places in the area. Radio Bakery has amazing sandwiches and pastries. There is often a line but if you catch them on the off-hours and a weekday then I recommend it. The El Jefe Mexican Truck is great for a late night bite. Mariscos el Submarino (one of my favorite spots in Jackson Heights) just opened a spot in Greenpoint so I would recommend checking that out, and a few blocks down is a cute cocktail bar called Bar Americano. | Hi I live in Greenpoint and would recommend: 
Edith's or Radio Bakery (focaccias and sandwiches are amazing, pastry is on the sweeter side) for breakfast over Frankel's or Lite Bites. Agree with others on choosing either Karczma or Pierozek, not both. Forma is not a nice family dinner spot, just the cheapest okay pasta takeout option for locals - Misi reservations are not too hard to get (compared to Lilia) as a very good pasta option. Mariscos El Submarino is great for Mexican if you like seafood. Ramirez doesn't really have what I would call seating, but is great for a quick snack. The good pizza in the nabe would be L'industrie, paulie g's, and Chrissy's. There are some hype places in Greenpoint that I personally thought were terrible (Wen Wen), but people's experiences seem to vary there. If the fam likes Japanese food I would also recommend Acre for lunch, Uzuki for soba, Dashi Okume for Japanese-style breakfast. Taku Sando also cute for lunch. Hope you have a good trip! | Would definitely skip The Bedford. So many great places to eat, wouldn’t waste your time there | I just want to come in here and neutralize Hometown cause I’m seeing negative comments. It’s damn delicious. I was literally there today in the afternoon and got everything I wanted. If you don’t have a car, it’s out of the way. Unless you wanna try to take the ferry to Red Hook (I think it’s still running?) from Greenpoint and then walk around during the day (grab a key lime pie- which I’m not personally a fan of, but everyone loves them) and then venture on, that may be your best bet. But maybe not for dinner. | Paulie G’s, 100%!! + Rule of Thirds + Nura. And don’t forget Peter Pan for donuts in the morning. Some of the best traditional donuts you’ll ever have. | Manetta's is Queens - LIC, so just over the Pulaski Bridge.  It is a classic. 

Jora, also in LIC, is Peruvian and really good. 

Second (or third) Ayada and SriPraPhai for Thai.  They are both my favorites.   If the weather is nice,  SriPraPhai has a wonderful backyard. | Hometown is bad | I went there once and they were sold out of everything | Seconding heading to Queens! | Oh nm just read you have a family. Maybe forma is good then it's pretty reasonable. I've never been tbf. | Second on San Mazarno. How is it even on your list? | Too many queens gems to mention. Food media has no clue about queens dining. They're all yokals pretending they can know all about NY food in 10
Years.

Queens has a lot of the best Asian food (Chinese, thai, Indian, etc) south and Central American, even burgers (donovans pub). 

They aren't as shiny and ""special"" in their appearance and preparation, but the flavors and food are more authentic, as they serve their communities of similar ethnicity. Look deeper into queens. It's the key to having unique experiences, some of which cannot be replicated any where else in the US. | Forma is one of my favs. Affordable, fast, and amazing. The pomodoro is 10/10!"
Need a great suggestion for a pretentious friend ,"I typically go to dinner w a few friends the week of Thanksgiving every year.  My one friend who usually organizes it is a bit of a Hollywood big shot and he likes to be seen and go to a fine dining spot.  The core of the dinner group have been friends for 50 years and 2 of the 3 us aren’t pretentious douche’s. The last few years we have eaten at Carbone and I want to shoot myself. He texted the group chat and said “where should we go this year”.  I said, let’s go somewhere w less bullshit and better food.  Well, I’m not in the city that much anymore but I’m looking for thoughts. A place thats loud with laughter, the food comes in bunches and is delicious but the place isn’t filled with people looking to be seen.  Help me, I can’t go to some fine dining place again where my friend holds court…..

Edit - just an update as my friend just texted me that he made multiple reservations.  His preference is Emilio Balloto’s as he says it’s filled with “famous people”. I just swallowed my vomit and hope that isn’t the destination.  Great suggestions so far","Quique Crudo... new spot in West Village/Hudson Square with incredible seafood and special vibes.. little loud but the hollywood man might like it, slightly sceney

Torrisi.. Major Food Group (same owner as Carbone), but better food + has the star -- very sceney, hollywood man will love it



Don angie / artusi / carota.. other sceney west village italian spots with solid food

  
rezdora / massara for more upscale italian.. | Le Cuocou--sceney enough for your friend, close to nightlife for fun (try tigre for afterdinner drinks/ lounge) and good food that's upscale/ fancy but fairly unpretentious...

Torrisi- also sceney enough/ famous enough for Hollywood (he's def seen it on his friends' instas) but also extremely delicious food

Semma- hard to get a reservation, but truly no bullshit delicious indian food

Dhamaka- also ditto- but a more casual atmosphere

Crown Shy/Overstory- fun and young vibe

seconding Hawksmoor for steak, also great martini

Tatiana- if you can get it this checks all your boxes, young and fun, sceney but not too sceney and food un unpretentiously unapologetically delicious.

8282- Korean, more casual, but very delicious and close to lots of nightlife, Nooretah for another very casual vibe (hawaiian/asian)

Attoboy- also Korean very fab, not pretentious, skews younger and more casual, tasting menu

Minetta Tavern- again if you can get it is always a fun place, classic, great burger, great martinis

Bar room at the modern, Marea  more unpretentious and uptowny things.

53 for more uptowny but still very sceney, older people who are re-capturing lost youth, lots of ppl who look like Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are their fashion inspirations..

If they are upper east side ppl- Cafe Sabarsky (sp?) very austria, very salon

Wallse if they are a little stodgy in the scandinavian way (great for someones' conservative but cultured NPR-esque parents)

Clocktower- for people who are less scandi then Wallse but still NPR-esque

Mel's -cool casual pizza and cocktails, also near some nightlife

Loring place- a more casual and younger clocktower

Kosaka - if they are into very cool but understated omakase

If a real hype beast: Cote, or Coqadoc

If they're dead boring and a square: Le Rock or Manhatta (food is good quality, but very square, not one lick of imagination on these pople, very finance)

If they must have Carbone, try Bad Roman- same same but different.

Can't think of others rn but this covers almost all of my friends and out of town family/friends..... good luck! | Hawksmoor would be a fun steakhouse environment that’s loud. Plus customer service is top notch. | Grandma""s Home | What part of town and what cuisine you looking for? | I know everyone has said it already, but the answer is so obviously Torrisi; it’s just Carbone with much better food. And chiller than you’d expect. | Homestead in Manhattan or Antica Pesa in Brooklyn are both great for this | Everything worthwhile is gonna be booked already. But try Borgo maybe? Brand new spot. Or Le Rock? | What about an unpretentious fine dining spot? Like 63 Clinton. 

Wayan is just sceney enough (at least with fashion ppl) and the food is actually great, with fun dimly lit sexy ambience. | A few special places he would love:
- Torrisi
- Coqodaq
- Polo Bar 
- Minetta Tavern
- The Grill
- The Corner Store | loud with laughters and good time sounds like sushi on me in jackson heights

less boisterous but good food minetta tavern, ilili, wonjo, jongro | A few I like that fit the bill… One Fifth, Barbuto, Osteria Carlina, Ernesto’s (actually see a lot of celebs here but it isn’t known for that) | Go to Ukrainian East Village restaurant and bring the laughs- the most unpretentious place on the planet and their snobbery will show their ass in 10 seconds. | This is your friend? | I heard Beyoncé and Jay Z recently ate at Claud and that the food is amazing | Hyun is a AYCE wagyu Korean bbq. It’s elevated, they cook it for you, and everything was delicious! It’s not a boisterous place because they kind of segregate the restaurant into small sectioned spaces but I absolutely loved the food and experience. | Nightly’s | Torrisi is exactly what your looking for but Raouls is way way cooler. | Check out RH Rooftop restaurant in meatpacking district. It’s at the top of Restoration hardware. The food is very good, and the atmosphere is very nice. Really nice views and buzzing but not loud. Would probably be acceptable to someone pretentious even though I don’t think it’s a pretentious foodie destination. | Go eat some Korean BBQ - Jongro, Wonjo, Hyun, Cote

Or Minetta Tavern | I really appreciate this list.  Thank you! | Just based on your screen name I’m gonna check it out | Looks fun. Is the food great? | Manhattan and just a great place. We have done Per Se and Carbone the last few years.

I would love something more chill. A place not to be seen but has great food. | He can get us in pretty much anywhere.  That’s not an obstacle. I just don’t want that kind of place. | … you think a Hollywood guy from out of town is going to Jackson Heights? | Since we were 3.  If we didn’t have that history we wouldn’t be friends.  He’s a narcissist.

From the age of 31 to 48 I refused to speak to him.  My other childhood friend convinced me to give him another chance.  He’s a lot. | He mentioned this spot….that scares me. | skip jongro and wonjo. mr hollywood can get comparable if not better korean bbq in LA. | Definitely do not go here. It’s a chain with over 200 locations in China, which would be fine if the food was anything special. I went once and we got a half-dozen things. Everything was missable. One of the dishes was drowned in sauce that tasted like diluted peanut butter. | A group of 4 of us went and it was delicious. The century egg is a must. We also got the scallion noodles, the clay pot chicken, the crispy eggplant and maybe 2 or 3 more things I can't remember. | Why don’t you try Cafe Mogador in East Village? This place is a definition of unpretentious and has good food. 
If your wanna be Hollywood friend needs a story that will make him young and cool again, then you can tell him Woody Allen filmed Whatever works there.

How does that sound? | He would kill me if I took him to JH. I made a note though! | You don’t have to hang out with this person. It sounds like they suck. Save yourself the hassle of trying to earn this jamoke’s approval and stay home and read a book. | The other perfect place would be Polo Bar. | Yeah this dude sounds like the type that would never even think of leaving Manhattan lol. But I’ll also say Sushi On Me is fantastic, I’ve been three or four times now and it’s always delicious and a super fun vibe. Go with some less pretentious friends and have a blast :) | Why?  What is wrong with Jackson Heights? | lol. I really go to see my other buddy of 50 years. I tolerate the other donkey for him. 

We laugh about it afterwards but he gets under my skin. | You’re right, all the Hollywood types love it there. It’s the first place I recommend for rich tourists to go as soon as they arrive in New York. | My friend loves immigrants, he just hates if they are close to him. | I see. Well I hope you make fun of him to his face and get the waiter to join in. Enjoy your fancy evening and let us know where you end up! | I mock him with no mercy."
"Shipwreck Williamsburg Fish and ""Chips"" Review",,"Tbh I never got the fish and chips but I looooooved Shipwreck when I lived nearby. Owner is very friendly, and everything is fresh fresh fresh. You don’t even smell stanky fish like you do at most other fish markets because they keep it clean. I’ve had “sushi grade” salmon and tuna from there and it was great! | Surprised A salt is still around, ate once there and never returned | **TL;DR: Pretty good spot all around and decently priced for the neighborhood. The “chips” and lack of malt vinegar were a little disappointing for me personally, but overall, not a bad spot to check out if you’re nearby.**

I woke up the other day with a desperate craving for fish and chips for lunch. Not sure why, but sometimes you get those cravings that have to be satisfied no matter what. Like a lot of you here, I’ve tried the usual suggested spot in the West Village called A Salt and Battery. Quite frankly, their food is very bland, and all the times I’ve eaten there, I’ve had to convince myself that I liked it. I didn’t want to lie to myself this time, so I resolved to try something new.

I wanted to try Samuels Top Ranking Fish Shop, but they opened at 4. So instead, I originally planned on trying GG’s Fish and Chips. Wearing my favorite aquatic fragrance to suit the mood (Profumum Roma Acqua di Sale for the curious) I headed over to take the F train. Unfortunately, I absentmindedly got on the next train at the station, which was the M. Wanting to make the best of the mistake, I just decided to get off at the next stop at Marcy Avenue and find the closest fish and chip spot.

Shipwreck was the first result that came up on the search, and the lack of reviews made me a little hesitant at first. In hindsight, I think their first location already has great reviews, but at the time I didn’t know this. I skimmed through the menu and decided on the beer battered cod and “chips,” which were one of the more expensive menu items at around $15. The reason I say “chips” is because they were more like fries rather than the traditional thicker chips that you get at chip shops. This personally doesn’t bother me on its own.

After I placed my order, the food took a few minutes to arrive in the state that you see from the photo. I’m usually a malt vinegar kind of guy when it comes to fish and chips, and when I asked for some, I was sad to hear that they didn’t carry any. A bit of a bummer, but we carry on. The “chips” were up first and to be frank, they were a little over seasoned for my personal taste. They also didn’t really taste that much different from frozen grocery store fries, and I confirmed my suspicions when I look in the freezer to my right to see a bag of frozen fries. Thankfully, the fish, which is the most important part to me, was pretty good. The batter actually had a nice flavor to it, something that I can’t say for A Salt and Battery. It’s hard for me to describe the taste, but there’s this airy sensation in your mouth that gets filled with the tartness from the lemon, the slight heaviness from the oil, and the softness from the fish underneath. The tartar sauce was a little lighter than my personal preference, but it complimented the fish well. I didn’t think the chipotle mayo was anything special though.

So overall, I had a good experience, especially for the price. For $15 or less in Williamsburg, it’s hard for me to complain. Will definitely check out the other stuff on the menu when I am in the area.   | Dame for fish and chips. | As a Brit. Those aren't chips. | 1. The fish looks decent.  Those aren't proper ""chips"", those are fries, and they look breaded or seasoned, uff.

2. Packing the lemon in with the fried goods just soggies the fried foods. | A Salt & Battery was wildly underwhelming. The staff are very nice though! | Is this related to shipwreck in bedstuy? | Oh man, that looks good. | Fried red snapper sandwich is 🔥🔥🔥 overall both locations are great for sandwiches and as a fish market | The real question is - do they sell curry sauce? | Oh damn they’ve been on my list of places to try for a while. Anywhere you’d recommend in Manhattan? | Yeah I was wildly disappointed. | Same and that was like a decade ago. It's disgusting. No seasoning at all. | As an Aussie, I found A Salt and Battery pathetic. Tasteless fish, bad batter, undercooked and soggy chips, and they didn't have any lemon wedges they could give me for the fish, which is truly absurd to me. They only had artificial lemon juice. Not sure if it's less common in the UK but in Aus, fish and chips always comes with lemon wedges without needing to ask. | im from ldn live in nyc. No malt vinegar, means no fish and chips | Looks good but no malt vinegar is a deal breaker for me. It's essential! | Twice the price and 1000% better. Same is spectacular!! | >The reason I say “chips” is because they were more like fries rather than the traditional thicker chips that you get at chip shops. This personally doesn’t bother me on its own. | As an American - what’s the difference? I’ve always thought a chip was a fry? | And how do fish place not carry Malt Vinegar??  OP is very forgiving. | Fish looks mid at best | Yes | As an aussie, that couldn't find good fish and chips anywhere, I had them at The Headless Widow in the LES and they were amazing. I didn't know if it was a one off but it was one of those times where I keep thinking about wanting to go back. | Yeah the batter tasted like a waffle last time I went. Awful. | UK gets fresh lemon, its 'our' dish afterall | I lived in Melb for 4 years and I've had some truly awful fish/chips there.. once I got sick. I think it was because they hadn't changed the oil in ages. | Not criticising you, friend. Just passionate about chips 🙂 | They need to be thicker than a fry. Something like this [chips](https://images.app.goo.gl/BYrEDQ9QLL51QDHr5) | Look. I’m not a stickler for pure authenticity. I understand that sometimes authentic ingredients and technique can be hard to come by. I am very forgiving of restaurants making cuisines from my home country too. What matters to me is that the food tastes good and that the people behind it put an honest attempt | Bet I’m On my way!! | Ah good tip thanks! They're also pretty good at Snowdonia, a Welsh pub in Astoria. | Debatable | Um yeah I know it comes from the UK, like most of our food.. doesn't mean we eat it exactly the same way. | Oh definitely plenty of bad options, but once you find your spot you're golden. I'm from Sydney and northern NSW though so idk maybe it's generally worse in Melbourne. | Yeah those definitely are not chips and it’s insulting to call them that 😎 | Ok.  So I guess we’d just call them thick cut fries. | Hey I'm right there with ya!  Not asking them to brew their own vinegar,  but a $4 bottle for a fish and chips shop ain't asking much. My SO is British so it comes up alot lol...

Appreciate the thoughtful review tho! | Funny I live in Astoria, but have never heard of that. Going to check them out! | Melbourne has some banging fish and chips. | Steak fries are the closest from what I've seen, but cooked properly they're fantastic.  Sadly most places here they're terrible. | Oh cool! Let me know if you find any other good spots in Astoria."
I know we talk about pho a lot but what about pho in north Brooklyn or even Ridgewood? I’m having a very serious craving ,Rare beef and brisket are my favs…never really tried any other kind.,"Di An Di

Funny story about a 2-star Michelin restaurant in NYC ,"I work at a Trader Joe's that's close to a 2-star Michelin restaurant (I didn't know it was, I looked it up tonight).

Anyway, I don't know which members of the kitchens they are, but people that work at that restaurant come in to the store almost EVERY day to buy ingredients lol. They wear a hat embroidered with the restaurant's name, and they almost always have white shirts.

They buy a ton of stuff: sour cream, handsome cut french fries, milk, oranges, soy sauce, nuts, herbs, etc.

I have no clue if they're serving it to the diners or themselves, but this place is INSANELY expensive lol.","Lot of places do this! Late deliveries, short on product, food for family meal! Normal! | Pretty sure the only 2 star restaurant around that’s really close to a Trader Joe’s is Atomix they’re not really using any of those ingredients. Probably doing a family meal | So who’s gonna figure it out lol. Going against the grain, they might be picking it up for what restaurants call “family meal”, which is when one person is delegated to cook dinner for all the staff members at the restaurant. You don’t always have ingredients on hand for the family meal so if TJs is nearby then it would be a reason they would be there | List of two michelin star restaurants in NYC:

1. Junksik  
2. Saga  
3. Atera  
4. Atomix  
5. Odo  
6. Aska  
7. Modern   
8. Aquavit  
9. Jean Jorges  
10. Sushi Noz  
11. Daniel  
12. The Modern. 

I doubt any of these places wear embroidered hats. I KNOW none of them serve french fries. I'd bet money OP is making this up and if he isn't he should name which restaurant he claims. | My chef took my TJ bag of honeycrisp apples I brought in for snacking and used it for service because the apples they got delivered were mealy. | I don't get what the rage bait is here. They pay more at trader joes than they'll pay in bulk for ingredients from their suppliers mostly. I mean think about it, you're getting less bulk, more middle men, of course its going to be more expensive. Are you mad they're wasting money at trader joes or what? | They're buying ingredients? To make food? What is your point?(???) | This happens all the time - late deliveries, someone forgot to order something, picking up something last minute for family meal, recipe testing so you’re not making huge quantities. I run a restaurant and I always joke I’m the guy in the math problems because sometimes I’ll be buying 10 lbs of garlic 😂 | They can be shopping for themselves to bring home while in uniform. Everyone from my job does this. | Shocking. Food is made from ingredients. Alert the media. | Of course they do, you’re a respectable grocery store nearby, and sometimes (A.K.A every fucking day) there is something they don’t have.

Any restaurant(much less a 2 star) is going to have hundreds of ingredients, and dozens of vendors.

Yeah, they’re going to go to the grocery store next door every day.  If there going there and buying cheap, frozen chicken breasts or old meat, I’d be concerned.

If they’re there buying sours cream and butter and flour… yeah shit happens.  

You don’t go out to a store with money to make family meal for the staff.

This is a high end restaurant that runs out of shit and needs to get things from a nearby grocery store | There is nothing noteworthy about this 

Breaking: Restaurant shops for ingredients | I am missing why it would be concerning that they buy Nuts at a grocery store. | Not every single ingredient is some sort of high-end gourmet product. Usually you wouldn't go and pick stuff up from a supermarket, because you can get it cheaper wholesale, but if you run out of stuff or a delivery never came or there's a guest with a special request or the chef just wants to experiment with something new, then that can definitely happen. | Definitely for family meal, very few two star restaurants are serving French fries | Umm yeah, every restaurant does this? You run out shit sometimes and can’t wait till the next delivery. I don’t think I’ve ever worked at a place where I didn’t have to send someone to go run and grab more milk or something. | A two Michelin star restaurant is not serving frozen store-bought french fries. | Omg people who work with food buy food | Totally normal. Lol

Once we ran out of red food coloring for the red velvet at the hipster bakery I worked at.  Had to go to the store of course and buy it. I’m sure buying literally all the tiny bottles they had looked weird AF. | Maybe if they were buying frozen lasanga or the cacio e Pepe to pass off as their own dish but …. If you’re a grocery store next to a restaurant ( any restaurant) you’re going to get visited for pantry ingredients (milk, soy sauce, herbs, nuts) if they are out/low of supply | My guess is Aska. Two stars and the Williamsburg TJs is nearby | Like others said - family meal. But the Union Square farmers market does supply a few 3 stars. | Nothing funny here | This smells like family meal to me. | Trying to figure out why this is funny | Milk is a commodity product especially when used as an ingredient, so yeah if they’re short on milk for some reason it makes sense to just pop next door and grab some. | You work at a grocery store and restaurant staff buy groceries from your work

I don’t understand which part of grocery store and food industry staffer makes this a funny story at all? | Maybe restaurant doesn’t wanna carry inventory?  Who cares though | my roommate works for a michelin star sushi place downtown and when they had a guest request vegan sushi last minute they just doordashed it from a local place for $20 and served it for $250 lmao | While it may be normal, I do get why this could be rage bait targeted at Michelin star diners. I mean just at a grocery store alone there’s 20 different types of eggs varying between $3-10 a dozen. If you dine at a 2 Michelin star restaurant, you hope they aren’t cheating out on ingredients given the price you’re paying for the meal. 

I wouldn’t be able to distinguish the difference between most things except maybe seafood and meat but maybe someone willing to spend $350 on a pre fixe would (or would care if they knew.) | Definitely a family meal, either that or a mix of things. if a delivery fucks up an order and they don't include (for example) soy sauce, the item requiring it can't just come off the menu. | That reminds me of a time I went to Whole Foods and was getting some vegetables when this one guy starts grabbing all the endives and asks the produce guy if there’s any more endives as he needs more endives.

Edit: he was dressed for higher end hospitality and also briefly mentioned something to the guy about a restaurant | I can buy paint from Home Depot too. Doesn’t make me Picasso. | Op which Trader Joe’s do you work at | Restaurants run out of ingredients all the time but I’d be really annoyed if the fries I was eating at a Michelin starred restaurant were frozen from TJs ( though I assume it was for family meal) | You’re saying that a cook….from a restaurant…came into a grocery store…and bought food to cook? My god. The horror. | No wonder you work at a Trader Joe’s with this kind of critical thinking ability.  | If it’s for something like cream and pantry items like soy sauce and nuts it’s not a big deal. The high price tag at restaurants like this is mostly for: center of plate ingredients (proteins, rare ingredients that are the focus of the dish, etc), the labor and technique in preparing complicated dishes, and the service/ambiance. Unless you’re a place whose gimmick is all local/self grown ingredients I guarantee you most make up for high food costs with buying lower quality commodity items unless they’re crazy bank rolled, esp in high rent cities like nyc. 

Also Michelin’s a fucking racket anyway you gotta pay for those stars | As a chef in NYC, includes four star, this is actually common for smaller amounts of ingredients.  I love you all. | Tbh it’s not like high end restaurants have some magical superior quality products.. if it’s the basics like carrots or celery it’s essentially the same product anywhere you go. The difference is the prep, quality of proteins, and then of course specialty produce whether it’s rare mushrooms, fruit, certain leafy greens etc. If you’re eating romaine for example whether it’s a food truck or expensive restaurant it’s the same thing. You didn’t catch them doing anything “wrong.” | 8/10 bait. Got a lot of responses | This is all so funny to me, an actual NY chef that's worked for a few very well known restaurants. 

It's not that common to shop all the time, but it happens. The busier the restaurant the more common it might be. But just hilarious how many ""foodies"" read and involve themselves so heavily in the food scene that they so confidently give answers that are definitely out of their depth of understanding.

Play on. I just enjoy all the reply guys. Me included I guess. 

I'd say most legit well run restaurants make a couple small store runs a week. But pretending to know why? Even I wouldn't do that. Bc every restaurant is different, and a lot of NYC restaurants have been in constant managerial and staffing flux for 5 years now.

You guys all need to just enjoy the food. And keep eating. Bc the business end has never been harder, and independent restaurants are almost all struggling.

So if you wanna fan the flames, just know you're just helping the well capitalized cookie cutter restaurant groups from increasing their stranglehold on the NYC restaurant scene, especially in Manhattan. Where's the landscape has NEVER been this brutal. | I went to some place where they served pate, but without anything tangy to pair it with.  Asked if they happened to have any cornichons or anything in the back, and I saw a staff member coming in the front door with a glass jar of cornichons 5 minutes later, and they served it to me on a pretty plate a minute after that.  The rest of the food was meh for the price, but the service was soooo amazing.   | Every restaurant does this. | La Vara? | If this was a cruise ship shopping daily at TJ’s I’d be surprised. | Sometimes those ingredients are used for staff meals too | Have a professional chef friend who said that real cooking skill is being able to make great tasting stuff fast and cheap. | We were at a two star Michelin restaurant in Chicago and they asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered their specialty Old Fashioned, my wife had tea, and our daughter asked what they had to drink. They said name it and if they didn’t have it they would run to the store nearby to grab it. Thought that was pretty neat. | Snarking and failing. | Restaurants buy ingredients from high end grocery store?? I thought they grew everything themselves! | Name and shame or it didn't happen 🙄 | Drop the name | The TJs in Chelsea definitely is near a few Michelin starred restaurants | Probably odo. It's half a block from the Chelsea TJ on 6th Ave. | HAHAHAHAHAAAAAHHAAAHAHAHAHAHAAHOO | >handsome cut french fries | If I’m paying $300 for a meal I don’t want $3 sour cream from Trader Joe’s near my plate | Vestry? | tjs chelsea and oiji mi fits the bill'

edit: nvm, 1 star | Was going to say family meal for sure | It's not normal to do this every day, it means that either they're really pants on head bad at ordering or they desperately need to switch suppliers.

If it's for family meal it's still equally odd, you can get those goods from your suppliers as well.  Again, an odd item here and there? Sure. Every day? why? | I miss managing a restaurant next to a grocery store. I used to run across the street to buy small gifts for our guests, last minute shit for family meal if the kitchen was weeded, and ingredients that were far cheaper to buy at retail on the fly instead of placing an order with a distributor, waiting overnight, and paying fees for not hitting the minimum. Also there’s no deliveries on Sunday where I live. 

I had a sous chef pay $60 for a couple lbs of parsley, the parsley was $10 and the fuel surcharge and delivery fee was $50. We can buy parsley at the grocery store, my guy. I was fucking incredulous when I coded that invoice. | It's not atomix, afaik they dont have embroidered hats in the uniform. | There is also Aska in Williamsburg which is just a few blocks from a Trader Joe’s on Kent Avenue. | Yea very possible…still want OP to name drop them though lol | They would use produce from their suppliers for family meal. | Nougatine serves French Fries and is 10 minutes from the UWS TJs.  And is obviously the sister to JG.

Edited to add:  Although I'm enjoying the hunt,  who cares?  Could be family meal, could be for diners.  Sometimes restaurants run out of things. | Based on my search, which was not perfect, Atomix appeared to be the closest, at 0.2 miles and a 5-minute walk. Most places were about 16-30 minutes away. | Saga is the one that’s most likely to wear hats, since a lot of their chefs are into street wear. But I really don’t believe any of them would have embroidered hat. As some people mentioned, it could be for family meal, but I’m pretty sure if you’re working at a 2 Michelin star establishment, you’re more likely to make everything from scratch… not just the french fries but perhaps also the sour cream. So honestly probably if anything, just recipe development or personal use. | Could help to add distance to nearest tjs for each | Odo is a 4min walk to TJs.  Probably buying gifts to bring back to Japan.  My relatives always want TJ shopping bags and seasonal snacks.  I dont think they wear hats. | Daniel is just under a mile away from Trader Joe’s. | Guy doesn’t realize that commodity ingredients are commodity ingredients and thinks somehow they have special onions nobody else has access to. | Food serving place buys food from local food store??? The scandal! | Hey I have a wholesale produce distribution company! If you’re ever in a pickle we’d be happy to help! We’re family owned and we understand shit happens, we offer same day deliveries for emergencies for all of our customers in the 5 boroughs. | Its very confusing. I guess he feels like they must be getting ripped off because the ingredients come from a grocery store. But with a large contract with a supplier for bulk ingredients, even for really high quality ingredients they're probably paying a much higher markup by shopping at TJs, there's more middle men in the chain... its certainly something they just don't normally stock or they're out of that they need. | I went there recently, if they can make food that good with TJ's produce they probably deserve the two star. | Really? With what? | Curious to know where did they doordash it lol. I could use some sushi, knowing very well it could go for $250. | He was a huge Behr fan. | I've never been to a 2 michelin star restaurant that served fries haha. | [removed] | Restaurants do not pay for Michelin Stars... where did you hear that? Inspections are anonymous.

Countries and tourism boards pay the Michelin guide to boost food tourism in the area as it will help them find places for bib gourmand, stars if they do them in that location, etc... But nobody can pay for stars. And you get re-viewed at least every 18 months, sometimes more often for high ratings. | scandalous ten far-flung familiar liquid subsequent spark saw ink rinse

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* | Do you have more info on that? went to La Bernadin recently and was let down with the 3 star | You're not eating a tub of sour cream when you go to these restaurants | If you’re laying $300 down for a meal and it tastes to you like it is worth it, why does it matter where the sour cream comes from? | You realize they're not JUST using it as sour cream right? Like it could be in a soup to thicken it or baked into other foods or used in sauces. Not to mention there's really not that much of a difference from 3$ tjs sour cream and any other ones. Plus most of the stuff you get from distributors is exactly the same it's just cost effective because it comes in bulk which is why you use them. | You’re not getting it. As others said, sour cream is probably for family meal. Or because their delivery of sour cream that ends up inside a baked good didn’t arrive in time. They would absolutely not put that on your plate without doing something with it. That is a silly and naive notion. | I disagree - this is normal, and I see it all the time, at restaurants large and small, expensive and neighborhood. 

Even if you knew you'd need 541 eggs for brunch on saturday - which you don't - vendors might only sell in multiples of 1,000. So you think, ""ok, I'll get 1,000 eggs for this weekend"", and if you only use 800, so be it, and if you use 1,200, you just run to TJs and get a few more cartons. 

It works exactly like energy markets, base-load and demand-response. You run a stable base-load to cover most of your needs at low cost, and supplement with high-cost, but more marginally liquid supply. 

But there's so much more. Restaurants are brutally low-margin and always going out of business, and inflation / supply chains / quality-based-shrinkflation has hit food ESPECIALLY hard. These restaurants are choosing between worse inputs at higher prices, or wayyyy higher prices. Not surprising to see restaurants managing inventory conservatively, sometimes buying more variable-supply inventory to avoid wasting big on over-purchasing. 

But wait - there's more. This is why toast is such an important company. They functionally work as the ERP for restaurants, since no restaurant actually has an inventory managmement service. This is actually why toast is popular - because they optimize all these purchasing choices for the restaurant. What makes toast particularly powerful is that they integrate with resy and opentable, which work as the ""CRM"" or sales side for restaurants. CRM + ERP is resy/opentable + toast. 

These processes are highly structured, especially at restaurant group places like michelin star restaurants. Yeah, it's probably run sub-optimally relative to an imaginary world with perfect managers and perfect employees, but the world is messier and this stuff is how the world works. | I’ve worked in very high end kitchens in Philly back in the day and this is super common. It’s not always because an order was late or we didn’t order something we need, though that was part of it. There’s a million other reasons like you drop something, something goes bad, there’s a run on a particular dish that’s outside the norm. It may just be the chef saying “I think the see bass special needs something, grab me some chanterelles from the shop across the street”. | This is new york. Trader Joes is by far cheapest source of groceries. Not sure how it compares to direct suppliers, but it can't he much worse. | I’m a supplier and you’d be surprised some of the biggest restaurants in the city constantly run out of stuff and don’t order properly. We’ve thrown stuff in Ubers and had it delivered because the places had nothing left for their salads. | If you serve a long tasting menu with lots of seafood (most long tasting menus) and you're a really good restaurant then you serve a lot of stuff that was caught that same day. Freshness will absolutely make or break you.

So when one of your fishermen comes in that day whatever he has is what you're limited to. Sometimes they just don't catch what was expected or the thing you expected isn't looking particularly good, but they have something else that looks good. Sometimes one fisherman misses a delivery. It happens. Either way you need to replace what you expected with the next best option, and you need to design a new dish around that so obviously you need to hit the market because you didn't stock up for dishes that you haven't even designed yet. | Wait. Where else do you wear pants? | Incredible how fucking expensive distributors are. | I’d say Aska is the next closest but I was there recently and definitely no hats | The staff doesn’t wear hats | You’re falling for bait | [deleted] | You could forget to place an order, order doesn’t come, plenty of reasons to buy from a store at the last minute it’s not like Baldor is as fast as Door Dash | It depends. All restaurants are different. Some are small and have no left overs and bigger ones have enough waste that they can turn it into family meal. 

Some restaurants don't have family meal at all | They share the same kitchen and ingredients with JG- I just ate there last week and the waitress confirmed this… | Atera to Trader Joe's is pretty doable.

Jean Georges also has like 80 billion restaurants other than the self-titled one. I don't know who is wearing these embroidered hat uniforms, but you could see his name and assume its the flagship restaurant when the person could be associated with any of the other 80 billion restaurants. | They do not have embroidered hats. | Even if they use Frozen Fries. I doubt they are getting them from trader joes. Most Restaurants would need larger bags and companies like Lamb Weston (which you can actually find some of their SKUs grocery store) which traders joe are more likely choices.

And a restaurant doesn't become a Michelin star restaurant by compromising on consistency/quality. These are not places that would just buy random bags of fries from stores. Most of them won't run out of ingredients, because they served a fixed number of customers every night (i.e. 10 seats, 3 seating a night type deals) and are serving tasting menu. Which is why I think OP is making this up and his post history makes him look like a bored college kid. | Of course they’re all buying from Baldor, Chefs Warehouse, etc.  But you run out of stuff. Or you want to do recipe development.  Or part of an order gets left outside the walk-in.  There’s all kinds of reasons you might need to source at retail at the last minute, and in the end, the kinds of stuff he’s talking about aren’t specialty ingredients.  It’s staples that yes, you can buy anywhere. Including TJ’s.  Better there than Whole Foods. | I found a mini cone in my ceviche once. | Yup. It’s not the specialty stuff, it’s “oh shit we ran out of sour cream can you get a tub?” | EMP notoriously buys from the union square farmers market | With what??? Have you ever been to USQ Greenmarket 🤦🏻‍♀️ | No that’s why I think it was for family meal | No hate, flamewars, rude comments, etc | Some cities have tens of thousands of restaurants. Does Michelin knock on every door? They don’t directly purchase them from Michelin, but there is definitely a correlation between restaurants with stars and ones that can have more financial backing, have a higher marketing presence, connection to local govt/tourism board, etc. I would bet a large group has a higher chance of getting reviewed than a mom and pop. 

It’s also a matter of the city’s privilege to be able to afford Michelin to come to their city. A city like Orlando with a huge tourism and Disney money can pay to have them come out, but a city like Baltimore with equally good food will be overlooked because they can’t afford it. 

I guess I was speaking in extremes bc I was stoned and tired lol but we can’t ignore the fact there is privilege involved in Michelins ratings. And at the end of the day, they are a for profit company with a bottom line to deal with so I don’t fully trust their opinion is completely untainted and not able to be purchased. | Le Ber is so overrated imho. I've been twice, in case the first time was a fluke--it was not | You’re good with scamming people? A talented chef can make something taste good for $10 | To that point… I wonder if it’s actually MORE expensive for the restaurant to go buy these ingredients individually at retail price versus buying it wholesale from their suppliers. | [deleted] | Now I'm kinda wondering if the reason the palak paneer is almost always sold out first is because some local restaurant has been secretly thawing and serving it to their customers. It is very good, but restaurant quality should taste quite different. | Not familiar with 86. | Im pretty sure this post is rage-bait cause i dont think a single 2 michelin has embroidered hats with the name on it. Maybe not any michelin at all because usually if anything is embroidered its the apron and/or chef jacket. | Not Aska. No hats in the kitchen. | If my staff is buying food from Trader Joe’s several times a week for family meal, I am sitting my sous down to talk about planning and budgeting or worse. | JG employee here, I can assure you no one is ever running to TJ for ingredients. | Yeah, its pretty obvious if you've been to either one. You pretty much walk through Nougatine to get to JG. | JG employee here, I can assure you no one is ever running to TJ for ingredients. | JG employee here, I can assure you no one is ever running to TJ for ingredients.

Edit: Also, no embroidered hats. | I heard Laut used to get their herbs there as well. | you'll still get your caviar, big guy. don't let it bother you too much | It 100% is. The place i work now does this a lot with liquor which is insane to me because of the crazy savings they'd have if they slightly planned ahead and used distributors | Almost certainly lol | Oh thanks, but it's really open knowledge. Covid accelerated it, but toast functions as an ERP that integrates with various CRMs - they coordinate meal estimates based on reservations, and even user profiles.... (theoretically and ideally). The rest of their stuff is nice, but it's not mission critical (like white labeling an ordering system - everyone does that). Let me see if I can find something about it

edit: wow, i really can't find anything. I promise it is open knowledge, to those who know. But i guess it's not interesting enough to discuss (who gets excited about ERP systems i guess). But this stuff is the guts of every business, as this whole thread points out | For restaurant quality you just add more fat and salt to finish it. | Why would you 86 a popular dish if you can grab what’s missing before service? You ever working fine dining? You’re creating an experience and it’s not a good experience to tell someone you’re out of the dish they want. | It’s shake shack. Two stars for the shack stack.  | It’s bs. | Lot of people here just hate things that they can't afford. | you guys are crushing it... that tuna tar tar is still a dish to write home about...

is the lobster burger only on the JG side? I work on 57 and 8 some in for lunch like more than I should be... (esp when i can get a vendor to pay...) | Restaurant manager here … tons of restaurants have an inventory management system & don’t use toast. | If it’s a popular dish, then no excuse for missing elements. 

If not, move on and focus staff on the dishes you have. 

Buying pedestrian substitutions at Trader Joe’s is not how to operate a high end place. | They definitely buy precut fries so it tracks. | indeed, market is highly fragmented, but toast has the plurality. I'm using it as a brand-generic - but the key is the integration between the booking app (sevenrooms, whatever) and the operations tracking system (toast, whatever) | Ok dude. You got it all figured out. | Watching the Bear doesn’t make you a chef lmao | Their fries are the only thing I hate,  they are like Nathan’s.  Fun fact, I just learned that Nathan’s in Coney Island had table service, my friends husband worked there as a waiter.  | Because Trader Joe’s is so much worse than Sysco. lol | Nor does commenting on Reddit.  But in your case it seems to have eroded your ability to process simple concepts

Let's settle this once and for all – who makes the best bagel in NYC,One thing I made sure I did was try a bagel spot every day. I have thoughts but wanna hear yours first. ,"Me | Tompkins sq | Really awesome place, it's called the Search Bar. | I’ve read so many of these lists here and on the typical YouTube videos and Instagram reels and websites and I disagree completely with everyone still.

Tompkins remains my favorite, either the 2nd Ave or Union Sq locations. OG location is still good just way too busy whenever I go there.

My benchmark is a relatively straightforward order: untoasted poppy bagel with jalapeño/jalapeño cheddar, chipotle avocado, spinach artichoke, veggie/tofu veggie, or scallion/tofu scallion schmear. I usually throw on extra jalapeños or peppers if the store has. Not a salmon guy, but I did enjoy a small portion of nova one time from Tompkins. If a very common bagel type and schmear can’t slap then I don’t care for all the other fancy additions or collabs or whatever the store has to offer.

The B&W Cookie at Tompkins is also amazing. I don’t know where they source it from or whether they make it in-house, but the convenience factor for something that good is huge for me.

I still have to try some like Absolute, Utopia, and Liberty, but Apollo, Essa, Black Seed, Bagel Belly, NYC Jumbo, Popup, David, Murray, Zucker, and quite a few others do not come anywhere close to Tompkins; Jumbo was a distant second best.

I haven’t made a tour into BK or Queens yet, but realistically I wouldn’t make such a trip for a mere bagel craving anyway, just like I wouldn’t wait 3 hours at Adel’s just for a halal cart platter when a 5-minute wait competitor can be almost as good. | Astoria Bagels on Ditmars | Utopia, Queens location"

Middle eastern, ive always thought of ililli as the forefront of middle eastern fine dining, i know they entertain many middle eastern dignitaries when they are in town; I've not experienced much that is sit down fine dining, I'm sure there are a few other gems. | Nabila’s for amazing Lebanese.

Thanks! | Seconded on Pig & Khao. I also like Madame Vo in the East Village for Vietnamese, and Laut for Malaysian/Singaporean | Oh wow didn’t realize they were connected. Been dying to try Sawa | I loved Eyval, but Sawa is incredibly mid IMO, just poorly seasoned basic dishes I could’ve made at home in the hour or so they took to come out of the kitchen.

Monkey bar ,How hard to get a weekend dinner reservation in December? I have my concierge working on it but I have ptsd from Polo Bar. Should I reserve a back up? ,Yes. I’ve had notifications set up and only received open spots for 5pm or 10pm
Date night spots,"Visiting NYC from the UK and looking to visit a couple places for date nights. Would love to go somewhere that’s a good setting and we can dress up.

Criteria:

- Good vibe and ambience, romantic settings possibly low lit
- View of the city if possible (but this is not a strict requirement)
- All cuisines except french
- No more than $200 per person","One If By Land, Two If By Sea - classic American restaurant, interior is gorgeous. 

Mari Vanna - super cute Russian restaurant, prices aren’t too bad

Bad Roman - a bit more sceney/trendy, great ambiance and food, and has some decent views of Columbus Circle | Manhatta has a good view | Union square cafe"
Similar Restaurant to Dame,"Not necessarily the cuisine, which we loved at Dame. But looking for other spots that are small, cool vibe, good cocktails, and approachable food. Lower Manhattan focused. Any type of food welcomed! Thanks in advance! ","Raf's | Lord’s is their sister restaurant, different cuisine but similar vibes for sure— although slightly larger and darker inside, and a British-ish menu. The Commerce Inn is also larger than Dame but very cozy and has great cocktails and a mix of seafood and classic American dishes."
Chinese Food From Brooklyn,Hello I try alot of Different Dishes Like Half/chicken Spare Red Tips Chicken Wings Bbq Wings French Fries Egg Roll & Etc. Chinese Food In Ny Are one my favorite Great ingredients Make food taste So Good,Ok | Happythankyoumoreplease
Where can I find Beryan (Iranian street food) in NYC? ,I have been trying to find a restaurant for a while where I can find this Iranian street food. I just moved to NYC and hope to get any leads for this dish.

Saturday night dinner for big group? ,"Hi! I am looking for a restaurant that is able to accommodate 17 people for dinner in Manhattan or Brooklyn next Saturday night. I understand that we will have to call in advance or make multiple reservations, so we are just looking for recommendations for potential places! Here are some specifics/preferences: 

* Open to all types of cuisines
* Preferably in Manhattan, open to Brooklyn 
* Does not have to be private or semi-private
* Preferably seated all together or near each other, but not a necessity 
* Price range: > $100 per person 

Also, if anyone has any rooftop bars in Manhattan or Brooklyn that they recommend for a big group, that would be awesome as well. Thank you in advance! ","Dim sum palace or any large chinese restaurant | As suggested, any of the big Chinese places. That’s honestly probably your only option at this late a date. Golden Unicorn and Jing Fong come to mind as two of the largest ones. If you go to Brooklyn there’s quite a few in Sunset Park. 

You could check with Li’l Frankie’s, good pizza & pasta joint. They have some pretty large spaces but they do get booked up for parties, especially on weekends. 

For rooftop bars… I guess the only thing in your favor is people aren’t typically booking rooftops in November. Rooftop 93 is near Chinatown, which is probably where you’ll be eating, so maybe email them first and then radiate outward."
Best pasta for a surprise birthday brunch! ,"I’m new to the city and trying to pick a place for a surprise birthday brunch for my boyfriend’s birthday. He’s obsessed with pasta and I’m trying to pick between La Rina and Piccola Cucina Estiatorio based on all the recommendations I’ve received. It’s a larger group so I’m trying to find something with a nice vibe too! Help me! 

P.S. : More recommendations are welcome too.","I absolutely love Piccola Cucina and was going to suggest that without even seeing your full post. Pastai is also good. Zero Otto Nove is good for more space also depending how big of a group but not all that festive. 

Piccola is a little party with delicious pasta with good prices."
Korean BBQ bday group (teen),"I'm woefully unfamiliar with Korean bbq restaurants. My husband and I have been to *Her Name is Han* many times and I absolutely love it.  

Our son will turn 15 in a month and is interested in having Korean bbq with friends.

I reserved *Her Name is Han* for the week following his bday (table for 7) as his birthday itself and the following weekend were booked solid for that size group. It's a tiny place (which we love).  

Are the any other places I should consider that have a similar casual, cozy, authentic/home-cooked, lowkey vibe in Koreatown?","If you want full on Korean BBQ, you can try Jongro or New Wonjo. | Korean BBQ isn't the most low-key vibe, given the live cooking aspect. The restaurants are generally a bit loud, busy, and good for groups and quite casual. But for a first time, you might want to try Dons Bogam or Yoon Haeundae Galbi. | Hometown best Korean BBQ for the price and it's all you can eat. | New wonjo. Haven’t been in awhile but hope they still use real charcoal in the grills"
Tasting Menu with Great Cocktails - looking for recommendations ,Hey folks - I’ve got my birthday coming up in February. I love a good tasting menu and I prefer great cocktails over a great wine program. What are your recommendations for a tasting menu with great cocktails? Bonus points if it has a stellar red meat course on the menu.,"Atomix bar menu is excellent and each course comes with a cocktail. All very unique. And typically the last savory course is beef. Only six seats and not easy to snag a seat though when reservations are released monthly. | I hear good things about Clemente Bar (opened and operated by Chef Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park). | Oiji Mi | This is an insane recommendation because it's not in this city but I have to give it if you're someone who loves this specific combo. Akoko in london is incredible. The cocktails + menu are fantastic. If you have the opportunity/time/money, you should try to get there. | Too bad the bots take all the reservations in 2 seconds  | What’s the review on the plant based menu? I don’t typically go for that but would be willing to if it was exceptional. | And oops. Just saw your comment about red meat course. Suggest Bom which is in the back of Oiji Mi. | I've been to Eleven Madison Park but not Clemente Bar. The food was fantastic. I don't think you have to be vegan to enjoy it, but this is coming from someone who's mostly vegetarian although I do eat meat from time to time 🙃 I assume Clemente Bar is as good. | Cocktail menu on the Oiji Mi website looks awesome - does Bom have the same drinks?"

Best NYC Baked Goods to Bring Back to Hometown,"Hi guys! I’ve been at NYU for a few months and am going back home for thanksgiving. I would love to bring my fam something from a bakery here, but the flight is about 5 hours and I have to leave at around 6:45am. I was hoping to get recs on what people would recommend getting to bring back that would hold up for the night before and on the flight. I was thinking of getting something from the thanksgiving menu at Breads Bakery but idk if it would hold up. I was also considering a classic Levain cookie box, but I honestly wasn’t amazed by their cookies. Pls drop recommendations. Thanks!! for reference i live near union sq so somewhere nearby would be best","Breads bakery babka makes a great gift & travels well! Just make sure to order in advance :) | Black and white cookies from William Greenberg or Orwashers | Anything that doesn’t need refrigeration. Babka from Breads is always a good choice. (That said, I tried their Harvest Thanksgiving one before, and I wasn’t that impressed.) I also like their challah.

Or a dozen bagels from your bagel place of choice. | As others have said, bagels are always a great choice. Also the babka from Breads Bakery. 

Other suggestions:
1. Chocolate chip cookies from Jacques Torres, which are my favorite.
2. Get a mix of bagels and bialys from Kossar's.
3. Perhaps a basque cheesecake from Grace Street or Japanese style cheesecake from Keki might be interesting.
4. Knishes from Yonah Shimmel. | I always fly back home with breads babka for my family! Also levain cookies are even better the next day IMO :) | JANIES LIFE CHANGING COOKIES!! Pie crust cookies would be AMAZING to bring home for thanksgiving!! | Babka from Zabar’s travels well and the packaging is cute. It’s a really classic NYC spot. I also always bring bagels from my favorite neighborhood spot when I visit family back home. | I tend to bring people rugelach from Lee Lee’s and it’s always a hit | Merveilleux cakes from Aux Merveilleux de Fred are pretty awesome. | Bagels!! I’ve been in New York for almost 20 years and without fail, every time I visit my family in western NY they ask me to bring bagels. Order them the day before you leave and put them in giant ziploc bags. They hold up really well. | Zabars is always solid! | I don’t personally care for Levain cookies, but evidently they travel quite well.

Lee Lee’s Rugelach (near the Harlem Levain)

Babka, but i don’t know the best place now. 

Janie’s Life changing cookies - these pack and ship well, so you’ll be fine carrying them. | Veniero’s cookie tray | I would suggest an airtight container to store the baked goods in. That should insure whatever you end up taking stays fresh on the journey. | Box of Greek pastries from Poseidon Bakery. No refrigeration needed. | Babka from Breads Bakery would be fine. If you want to consider other goodies, any preference on type?

Some ideas:

-	chocolate babka, rugalach from Michaeli 
-	cookies from Culture Espresso, From Lucie, Mokafe 
-	pineapple buns and other baked goods from Tao Hong, Double Crispy, Tai Pan
-	banh bo nuong and other Vietnamese American / French baked goods

More ideas from today: [Dropped the ball: Looking for places to pre-order a Thanksgiving dessert](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gr47fn/dropped_the_ball_looking_for_places_to_preorder_a/) | I am partial to cinnamon babka from Michaeli Bakery. Their chocolate one is great too. | I love Zabars Babka-the chocolate one, and Zabars is a quintessential NY place. | Babka or challah from Russ and Daughters: These are mentioned as good options for bringing back from NYC | Veniero’s! | Little pie company | Box of pineapple bun w bbq pork from Mei Lei Wah bakery | Some koug amons and cookies from dominique ansel? | Just a really nice black and white. | Some pastries from Angelina’s Bakery | Zabars gift basket. | https://www.orwashers.com/ | If you/your family like candy, get little sweet treat! Way better than bonbon and perfect for people to pick on (even those that claim they don’t like candy lol). I bring it for any event I go to like holidays, bachelorettes, Friendsgiving, housewarming, etc. | Pastries from Chinatown - egg tarts, baked char siu boa, sponge cake | Get the black and white cookies from breads on the upper east side | Great question! For black & whites, William Greenberg’s are the best, but not ""OMG - Amazing!"". My wife brought a babka from Zabar’s, and it was surprisingly good. Their house brand rugalech (either cinnamon or chocolate) are excellent. As for Levain —Take ten people. Six will swear it’s the best thing they’ve ever tasted, three will say ""these are fine…"", and one will surreptitiously offer their once-bitten cookie to the family pet. That said, a platter of six or eight (yes, they have that many varieties), a good vanilla ice cream (like Ben & Jerry’s), and a really well-brewed cup of a quality coffee — you’re a rock star. | I’m sure you can find a lot of good stuff at Magnolia Bakery. | Burrow has the prettiest gift boxes of tiny cakes, cookies, and treats. A good variety of stuff that fits in a small box so it's easy to travel with. Not sure when your flight is, but it's only open Tuesdays through Fridays | Pignoli and rainbow cookies at an Italian bakery like Villabate or Rimini in brooklyn | If you want to bring something medium large Petee’s pie or magnolia’s banana pudding are both contenders. When I lived in Atlanta I had friends demand I bring some home from the main bakeries becuase the stuff they ship just isn’t as good | Cronuts | im in awe that you didn't like levain! i thought it was impossible not to like that cookie

veneiro's has a gift box for cannolis, where they give you a bunch of shells and a tube of filling. they also have a bunch of other great pastries to gift

breads chocolate babka was a great rec as well | Veneiro’s so bomb | Find Little Cupcake Bakeshop. Get some German chocolate cake or cupcakes. Also brownies. | Lard bread from caputos in Carroll gardens | Levain Cookies. | Biased as a greenpointer, but Peter pans

You can call on the phone to place an order and skip the line when you go | This is MOSTLY true but Thanksgiving week more than a couple other people have the same idea... def been sold out | Get from Oneg bakery or michaeli bakery. | YES. THEY ARE THE BEST | Is it hard to get? I’ve walked in and seen it available. Unless i was just fortunate timing when i went | This! But make sure it's the chocolate Nutella one, not the cinnamon one | I would put WG slightly over Orwashers, but wouldn't be disappointed to eat either.  Really no others I know of that come close. | If people would only look to the cookie... all our problems would be solved | Except get your knishes from Zabar’s | I second this!! Took some back home to my family in Texas earlier this month and they held up well | Hard agree. I bring these to parties and they are wildly popular. And they keep for a couple of days. | Show some respect for New York's food history. Get that new age content culture space junk outta here. | Not if you go there before 12-2pm

You just have to go in the morning it's not that bad | Oneg is the answer | Oneg ships via goldbelly so that may be an option | No they always have them there its fine | Very easy to get. | I’ve been to yonah’s a couple times and it just tastes like a big potato, not sure what is the hype. It’s not bad, but was expecting more.  | and at Zabar’s, their rugelach in prepackaged bags rather than at the service bakery counter. I prefer the cinnamon ones, but I’m sure the chocolate ones are more popular. | Good to know! | Yea i didnt get why someone commented to order them in advance. They’ve been available on walk in for me. | The pre packaged is pareve so I wouldn’t recommend it as it doesn’t have the buttery-sour cream goodness of the bakery ones. I prefer the raisin cinnamon as well!"
Is Korean Barbecue all red meat?,I’ve heard wonderful things about Korean Barbecue in Queens but the menus that I’ve browsed are all beef and pork.  Any recs for a place with chicken? ,"Generally yes if you go to a nice KBBQ place they won’t serve chicken, it’s typically beef and pork. There are definitely places that have chicken like AYCE places, but it’s really not a strength of KBBQ and more an after thought | Handling and dealing with raw chicken near your other meats at a korean bbq is not worth it | Where did you look so far? 

I doubled checked the menus of two popular restaurants in Queens: Mapo and Hahm Ji Bach. They have chicken and other non beef and pork BBQ like seafood. | Gyu Kaku is a Japanese chain, they have a wide variety of meats including chicken. | Pork is the other white meat 😉 | Wonder Pig in Sunnyside | Yes, go to KPOT. Great value, always clean, and very quick delivery for when you order off the tablet. Their cuts are also a nice quality, and they offer a ton of seafood and chicken in addition to beef and pork. | hahm ji bach has chicken | Dons Bogam offers marinated chicken, as well as seafood and a vegetarian mushroom paltter | Bunch of pork belly as well. | Meat Me BBQ has some chicken options. Sweet and Spicy, and Soy marinated I think? | KPot has chicken no? Also $22 for AYCE lunch 😆 | Typically pork and beef, there’s also squid 
I’ve not seen anyone order chickeb | Picnic Garden has chicken. | Don Don KBBQ is entirely pork and very good | Hometown is good for the price. | How so? It’s all raw meat being cooked and eaten whether it’s chicken, beef or pork right? | I was going to suggest Gyu Kaku as well. It’s not KBBQ but it’s very good and worth a visit. | Gyu Kaku is Japanese, which is objectively not Korean, but still very good.

Edit: Downvote me all you want, you people are just racist. | I wouldn’t recommend going to Gyu Kaku by cooper square. I went there a month ago and a rat/ mouse jumped on the booth next to me. I screamed and got up really quickly. Thank god I didn’t eat anything yet but I left right after. 

The manager (a male) was so nonchalant about it. The first thing he said to me was where did you see it go? I said behind the booth. He went searching for it like he can catch it or something. Upsetting that he didn’t even apologize. This just goes to show that he is aware of this issue and has been happening often. As I walked out of the restaurant he offered me a 30 % discount card. I took the card but I definitely will not be using it.

Before I entered the restaurant he was apologizing to another party and also offer the other party a discount card. That was a sign to not go in to it. I believe the other party also saw the rodent and left and the manager was trying to alleviate the situation. | One of the greatest places ever.  Went the week it opened and never stopped going back. | Kpot is insane🔥 | Because that place is trash lol. | Higher cook temp needed for chicken increases risk of contamination with the meats cooked at a low temp | Aside from one being Korean, and one being Japanese, I don't know anyone that loves one and doesn't love the other | Gyu Kaku is a guilty pleasure for me. Especially during happy hour it can't be beat | Yes, I said Japanese.... | Japanese’s bbq is called Yakiniku and is thought to be originated from Zainichi (Koreans living in Japan) back in the day | Don’t hibachi places do this pretty regularly? | You said Korean, but okay, gaslight some more. | [deleted] | They're doing the cooking for you and can theoretically make sure to not cross contaminate. | yes... but there's a huge difference between someone else cooking your meat and you, the customer being allowed to cook and manage and touch everything on your own without supervision. It's about the risk. | Yes but it's similar and has what they are looking for so I made a recommendation. Not that hard to understand. | That makes a lot of sense"
Midtown Suggestions,"Hey everyone! Surprising my fiancé with a weekend in NYC for Christmas/anniversary. Staying around 57th/6th, and due to the short time there prefer to keep recommendations within a reasonable walking distance in midtown (roughly).

Best GF-Option Brunch in Manhattan?,"what the title says. my (celiac) mother is coming to visit and I'm looking for a brunch place that will have things she can eat. the catch is that she doesn't tend to like places that are specifically gluten-free - she doesn't think the food is usually very good. for example, she hated modern bread and bagel, said the breads tasted like cardboard. something like a mexican place where she can eat chilaquiles would be more her vibe. reservations are a must.

preferably east side or upper west (we're going to the met beforehand), but open to any suggestions.","I feel like Friedman’s was always loved by gf crowd. I thought it was okay.

Hidden Gems at Christmas time,"Hello! Just planned a last minute day trip to NYC Dec. 7th with my mom and grandmother. We are doing basic sightseeing and seeing a Broadway show. 

I’m looking for a good dinner restaurant that’s not too expensive, close to Broadway or Times Square, and bonus if it’s decorated for Christmas (but any nice ambience is good). 

I know of the major spots like Lillie’s, Papillon, Oscar Wilde, etc., but they are all booked up in terms of reservations. Wondering if anyone has any recommendations that would be similar to those places but less crowded (I know, big ask on a Saturday in December, but thought I’d try). Thanks in advance! ","My go to spot for dinner and a show is Bocca di Bacco. Likely won’t be decorated. 

If you can walk a bit away from the insanity, I used to love Kellari Taverna. Prices were always reasonable (haven’t been in a while so maybe they’ve gone up). Feels festive but not overly decorated if that makes sense. | One of my fave spots a lil bit away from the direct chaos of Times Square is Pio Pio! It’s spacious and cozy.

Best Sushi places in booths?,"Hi all,

My girlfriend is visiting NYC in a few weeks and I want to find a sushi place to eat for a special night out.

The only condition she has is that she wants to be in a booth. I think that this is an issue, because my understanding is that the best sushi places are like bar-style restaurants?

Frankly, I don’t really care as long as she’s happy. Does anyone know any good sushi places that serve in booths?

Looking for any price from like $100 to $1000.

Restaurant Recommendations ,"Hello all,

Also Rubirosa in the W Village. EDIT sorry SoHo | Arturo’s on Houston street is a good bet. Good coal oven pizza and if you go in the evening they’ll probably have live music. Cool vibes in there.

Also John’s of Bleecker will have a long line but is a good sit down option as well | Further downtown but worth the schlepp - Keste | John's of Bleecker
Juliana's if you find yourself walking the Brooklyn Bridge. | Denino's! | For christs sake you need to go to Rubirosa in Nolita | If you're willing to venture uptown, Parla is great | You can try sitting at the bar at Una Pizza Napolitana if you want. It’s worked for ppl before | Mel’s, stretch, Joe and pats | Emporio is a solid spot | Go to Brooklyn…. Ops, Leo, Lucali, L’Industrie, Aces, Decades. | Mel's near Chelsea market, Rubirossa Soho | Zero Otto nove in flatiron! | See No Evil ! | you got plenty of good pizza places in that location were you will be at. | See No Evil Pizza | Lots of good ones on here but my go to is always Song e Napule downtown 

I have to say also, Una Pizza was one of the most overhyped meals of my life (and I’ve had many!). They have done a wonderful job with marketing and getting on various lists but my god, the most tasteless dough. Sorry I’m getting angry just remembering lol. You’re lucky to be skipping it! | Why isnt anyone saying anything about grimaldis?

Grimaldis is amazing. | Angelo’s coal fire pizza on 57th street.  It’s in Portnoys top 10 | Never mentioned here but visited recently and hit up rays several times....plenty of seating inside & out & two locations within minutes of each other on 7th avenue in around 54th to 50th | Song e Napule is absolutely delicious 🤤 | The village is only like 15 minutes away by subway. John's and Arturo's are very nice. | Native ny’er & I approve of this list! I might just add Lazzara’s if you’re in the area in midtown but wouldn’t say it’s a “can’t miss” | This guy's lists are ordered too from best to good. | Rubirosa is not in the West Village | I had no idea Wiley Dufresne had a pizza spot! I've waited on him in the past, which was a trip. | Went to stretch recently it was a bit mind blowing. Haven’t had food that “tasty” in a long time! | Arturo’s is the best coal oven pizza in NY in my opinion and the ambience is spectacular as well! Hard to beat | I second Keste, their diavola is delicious | Best pizza in the city. Get the clam pie!! | I used to live on Staten Island and we frequently went to Deninos for pizza and Ralph's Ices across the street for dessert! | Getting a mediocre rating from barstool is the best thing that ever happened to Arturo’s"
Lunch Spots near Brooklyn Borough Hall,"Hey Everyone,

I just started a new job and the office is in Downtown Brooklyn near Borough Hall and I was wondering what your recommendations you guys have for more affordable lunch options.. Lunch Specials are a plus.

 Any cuisine is welcome as I imagine I'll be mixing it up every so often",Khaosan thai is very good!
Good cocktail Brunch restaurant needed ,"Looking to take my slightly older relatives to a fun brunch next Saturday. Looking for somewhere with great cocktails (not bottomless). My first thought was Dante but unfortunately no reservations, any other suggestions like this?","Carne mare | For more affordable, Fumo has great cocktails and brunch | The Dutch. Standard Grill. | If you're able to go a little outside of the city, my friend brought me to Copperhill in Williston Park last week. I had the Rye Toast and an Irish Coffee and both were good. Their food was really good as well, especially the cinnamon donuts."
What popular meals are missing in NYC?,"We’re lucky here in New York to have an amazing variety of truly authentic food from all over the world. But what popular meals from other parts of the world do you think are still missing here? For example, in my opinion, Berlin-style döner and Balkan grill are underrepresented. There are only a few restaurants in the city that serve them","I’ve never been able to find decent gumbo or Cajun food in general here. | OP, Astoria has a number of Balkan restaurants. The Balkan mixed grill at Mimoza is my favorite, but Selo is also good. I’ve yet to try Ukus, Cevabdzinica Sarajevo, and the Rudar Club, but they all review well. | There are a few spots, but could certainly be many more. ITALIAN BEEF SANDWICH. | Last week I would have said Hawaiin BBQ. But thankfully that's not the case anymore with the banging L&L on Allen. Owner is cool and they make their plates just as well as other locations. | Nando’s

Have I written to Nando’s corporate begging that they open in NY? Have I done so more than once? That is none of your business. | Hard to find a good currywurst (NRW style) and pommes mayo. Schaller (edit: auto-correct) & Weber’s wurststube is a little off from what it would taste like at home. | Nyc doesnt do Buffalo wings well. More vietnamese options are needed, BBQ, mission style burritos, cajun/creole | VIET FOOD!!! | Anything Southern. Mexican is largely mid. Vietnamese is not great. | Breakfast burritos | Can you get a good roast dinner in nyc? Like roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and stuff ? | Good chaat and Pani puri in Manhattan. | Been looking for a place with good Paella | A German style bakery. When I say bakery I mean bread, not pastries. Although I don’t think a German style pastry shop exists either.

German restaurants are few and far between. I’d take Austrian, Swiss and Alsatian as well (UES has some). 

And yes. Döner. Most Americans don’t even know.


Wait, there’s more! Vietnamese food is lacking here. As is British food. Also, Mexican food here is subpar. Honestly most of the cuisines I actually like are not easy to find here :/ | Nandos | they literally have Doner-Haus in manhattan and now in Astoria, we have 2 german doner places in Astoria | I have not had good ribs here. Not a lot of good bbq in general, but ribs are lacking even at the places I’ve enjoyed more than others | You can find a lot of diverse foods outside of manhattan. Queens is the most diverse place in America and the food shows. 

You can get off at a different stop on any subway stop in Queens and find some amazing authenic cuisine. | Obviously Mexican will be a popular answer, but for me it is specifically breakfast burritos.

This is about to get extremely niche, but I am from Northern Virginia and there is a New Mexican chain called Anita's which makes amazing breakfast burritos and nothing in NYC even comes close to it. Like I am not expecting to find something that is ultra top tier but in my experience every BB i've in in new york has been incredibly mediocre. Maybe there are other NoVA transplants who can chime in and correct me! | I’m definitely getting the impression from a lot of the responses here that some of y’all (not all) are thinking only of Manhattan when we’re talking about NYC.

Like the person who complained that the only Chili’s being in Queens. Queens is NYC (until you get to the nebulous border when it turns into LI) | Tex-Mex. Not legit Mexican, but the bastardized Mexican called Tex-Mex. Miss it. Literally the only thing I miss about Texas. | I think Balkan food is popular around Pelham Parkway, the south part of Fordham, and eastern Queens. | Authentic vegetarian Indian food | For a city settled by the Dutch I haven’t been able to find the types of food you’d get in the Netherlands. Specifically Frikandel, Broodje Croquette, stamppot, filet Americain (although I guess it’s basically steak tartare). | Vietnamese chick here. we’re missing quality Viet and Thai. Pho here is mid and overpriced, and it’ll curb the craving but doesn’t quite hit the spot.  Mam in Chinatown is the closest to authentic northern Viet I’ve had, but it’s owned by a white guy. Soothr and Fish Cheeks are great Thai options, but there aren’t enough low key take out spots. | Persian - I know, I know we have a couple I’ve eaten at all of them & it’s seriously lacking in NYC. | Manhattan specifically - Taiwanese breakfast. 

You might think a certain shop in the East Village is it; it’s not. | After reading the first sentence of your post I was about to say Berlin style doner! Then I kept reading. It’s so weird that that hasn’t been replicated yet! | A Spam restaurant.

I know... but they do some great things in Hawaii with it. | Northern Vietnamese dishes like bun cha | Chicago style Italian beef. | New Yorkers are missing out on South African food | Real southern style bbq , Trinidad cou cou and fish, Real Trinidad doubles made with a doubles man / solo vendor . | A quality rotating sushi bar, AKA kaiten zushi | Speaking as someone who grew up around a lot of pho, a great pho spot. | Pho in my opinion was always a little weak and we still cannot replicate tacos perfectly…..

Still we do kick ass at so many other things | A proper unagi meal. And no, the unagi sushi ain't it. | Shredded hash browns for breakfast | The Borek of europe and the middle east are just not here :( Also the Moroccan/north african food options are very limited. | I would say Moroccan or Lebanese | I'm continuously surprised that breakfast tacos haven't caught on in NYC. Of course, y'all have the world's best breakfast sandwiches, so maybe breakfast tacos aren't needed, but it's nice to mix it up sometimes.

Edit: typo | In general a lot of regional dishes I could get when I lived in Brazil like casquinha de caranguejo  (a northern Brazilian crab salad dish), baião de dois (northeastern Brazilian beans and rice with grilled cheese and beef jerky on top), camarão na moranga ( shrimp stew cooked inside a pumpkin), and even the super sugary cheap basic açaí places that treat it more like ice cream than a health food. | Biscuits and gravy | At risk of getting destroyed, I’ll go out on a limb and say I haven’t found Mexican that does it for me the way it did in California (born and raised). But if you know the spot drop the name 👇 | My best rec is to follow along with Righteous Eats. They really do put great and smaller joints on the map for everyone AND they take care of the community both small and large. They also focus on every borough, not just Manhattan and the trendy parts of BK. 

First We Feast has a couple good folks who focus on specifics, and there’s a great guy who’s on the search for the best breakfast burritos in the Five Boroughs. | Mexican | BBQ that’s not Korean. | Why is there no Waffle House? | Mexican food is lacking in NY | This question seems to get asked here or in /r/AskNYC every other week | We had that topic here 15 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/s/bcd6OADy6I

It’s time to start using search guys, it’s 2024.. | Indonesian is pretty little and far between | Burmese | Dying for somewhere to do an Irish spice bag | A good fry up | Irish spice bag! | We have all sorts of burger joints and chains…

Except In N Out | I wish there were more hushpuppies in the City. | Tbh a solid turkish bakery there was simit sarayi, but that closed a little while ago. I desperately need a good fresh simit, bazlama, halka tatlısı, actually good baklava, etc... | Chamorro food! I need some chicken kelaguen and red rice in my life | Banging Indian Chinese / Hakka food like they have in Toronto. Wish we had a spot like Federick in Scarborough. Tried a few Indian Chinese restaurants in Queens but not the same | Porchetta sandwich’s past one mediocre option at Allantico Vinaio where it’s too thin cut and cold | Where’s the best place in the city to find Malaysian and Indonesian food? | German Doner Kebab on 6th ave is exactly what you're looking for. Doner Haus in the EV is pretty good too | Parsi Food. 

There used to be a restaurant in the West Village in the early 2000s. Since then Chef Jehangir Mehta used to serve some dishes off an on at his two restaurants. 

But nothing otherwise. | Hawaiian and viet!! | imo (as a Filipino), I just don’t think Filipino food here is just that great. Yes, a few decent spots in (Woodside) Queens but that’s just about imo | good Cuban food. everything I’ve had has been overpriced and pretty awful. | Underrepresented ≠ missing. | Good Hawaiian BBQ | Tell me where to get a fried green tomato, please! Such a rare treat! | Persian | Turkish stretchy ice cream although the owner mushy opened a bar/restaurant in Brooklyn | Traditional Cantonese sweets and pastries esp now that lung moon and golden fung have closed ;( | There’s v few good west African spots, specifically Liberian | NO LIBERIAN RESTAURANTS 😩😰😰😰 | TexMex. Specifically enchiladas. 30 years here and I've yet to find passable chil con carne. | Where do I find Armenian Pizza?? | Appalachian food | REAL BAKLAVA

If you’ve been to Turkey, then you know what I’m talking about. I’m sure other countries in the region have their own baklava too. The ones in Turkey were to die for and ruined all baklava in the U.S for me.

ICE CREAM

Van Leeuen and il laboratorio was meh to me. Their ice cream feels very light and il laboratorio has very…unique but boring flavors? If I had to choose a store brand ice cream I’d choose Ben and Jerrie’s. Give me the brownies, cake, cookies or cookie dough flavors. I want rich, creamy THICK ice cream and I couldn’t find that in New York. | Mango Sticky Rice | I don't think there's any Cambodian restaurants currently open in the city. | Great Mexican is non existent. | Cambodian, Laotian, Hawaiian (very excited that L&L opened though and can’t wait to try it), actually decent BBQ and Cajun, and west coast style burritos. | Indonesian food! I didn’t realize how little of it we had until I visited Amsterdam | Fish and chips.

Any average local chippie would smash a salt and battery | Cheese fondue | Peruvian chicken. The ones where you can get a 1/2 or quarter chicken and 2 sides for like $12. | As an individual who visits NYC often, I find a lot of South East Asian food (besides good Thai places) are not available. Burmese and good Vietnamese food, in general, are lacking. Not SE Asia, but even Filipino food is a rarity in NYC. Which is shocking bc I can see how much NYers would love a good comforting box of fried pork chop/loganisa-silog for under $10. I guess all the migration ended up on the West Coast and opened up shop, which I’m thankful for, but when I move, I will be missing Asian food that is not Chinese, Thai, or Japanese inspired. Also, the number one thing I hear from my Brooklyn native partner is: “I’ve never had good Mexican food.” Excuse me!? | actual good vietnamese food | A Chicago-style ""Italian Beef"" sandwich. | Ethiopian, Vietnamese, Cajun. | Affordable housing | Mexican food in general. What’s constitutes as good Mexican food here is mid at best out west. | North Shore Style 3-Way Roast Beef | [Kway chap](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&site=imghp&source=hp&biw=1440&bih=821&btnG=Search&q=kway+chap&oq=&udm=2) | Chori pollo 😭 | Good moroccan | Lower line is good, but it is definitely is a Brooklyn vibe and Brooklyn prices. Shout out to Yat’s in the Midwest - does the same food better for a third of the price. | Hawaiian food , can’t find any that isn’t poke bowls | Solid tex-mex. Yellow Rose does it well, but that's about it (I think( | No good bbq imho | I haven’t been able to find Pakistani as good as what I got in CA which has been super surprising | Viet food at a reasonable price imo | I want an icelandic hotdog place in nyc SO BAD. | Poutine. Tried the Pommes Frites but didn’t like it. Fresh cheese curds and gravy is just not a thing here. I had better poutine in south Florida because of the mass amounts of Quebec snowbirds. | We don’t have any good fucking carne asada fries out here 😭😭😭😭😭😭 The way they do it out west….. FML | Cuban food, especially pan con lechon | Authentic Druze style pita with real labaneh and olive oil dripping all over is what I crave and can’t seem to find readily here. | Cant find any Dutch food in NYC | Langos! | Garlic noodles similar to what they serve in sf | Toronto style Butter Chicken Roti.  I crave it from time to time and it just somehow doesn't exist outside of Toronto. | Poutine. It only shows up in bars or select restaurants and even then that's not too common. | No Welsh Food. Miss a bara brith. Welsh cake. Cawl. Rarebit. Lava bread. Absolutely delightful. | Good smoothies bowls that are thick | Hungarian food | Authentic Hawaiian style poke - intensely marinated and served with some rice. All the poke places in NYC I’ve seen seem to be more the typical fish salad style. If anyone knows of any authentic poke let me know! | I haven't looked very hard, but any biscuits and gravy recommendations? | Gorditas, very regional mexican. But yeah I haven’t found them quite like I eat them back home, or at all for that matter | I haven't found a great Mexican restaurant but would love to be proven wrong if anyone has any recommendations! | Japanese pepper steak. Ikinari was great, but over expanded and shut down over pandemic. Pepper Lunch opened one location just before the pandemic and also closed down. Sad. | Southern food. Having been born in NYC and lived in East Tennessee/Western North Carolina for over a year, the fried chicken in NYC is nothing like Southern Fried Chicken. And when NYC has “Southern Food”, it is often way too fancy and overpriced with not enough weight in taste to match how fancy it is. Things are closer to simplistic than they are to fancy and upscale. | A good bowl of chicken pho. Like the one they had at Turtle Tower in SF. | Anything and everything from Chicago. | I don’t know about missing, but haven’t found a good shawarma yet.. | I have yet to find a really good Malaysian style laksa which I really miss | a proper dutch pancake? Like the big wide ones  (panencoeken) in the Netherlands with a fat knob of butter | Baltic food in general - I just want Rupjmaizes kārtojums! | Laksa | I can't find any stores that sell polenta taragna, or many people who even seem to know what that is! | Biltong after Jonty Jacobs closed | British-style meat pies, like Cornish Pasties, Bridies etc. | Very limited Ethiopian | North Korean foid | Texas style breakfast tacos | This is maybe an unpopular opinion but the Korean food here is kind of lacking. You can go really deep in flushing or go to Palisade Park in NJ for solid Korean food, but other than that… meh. I’m talking like regular standard Korean food not fancy steakhouses or Kbbq fusions like cote | If you know of a French restaurant that serves Blanquette du Veau, I've been looking for this classic French dish for years and I can't seem to find it in the city! | There are very few Cambodian/Laotian places. Plenty of Thai and Vietnamese but NYC does not represent the other SE Asian countries well at all in it’s culinary scene. 

Ohhh, how I’d love some prahok and legit, insanely spicy papaya salad right now. Maybe someday some place will come :) | Breakfast tacos | Burmese tea salad | Everyone comes to NYC and gets halal bros but they suck. The actual best Halal food is at “Brooklyn Halal Grill” on Liberty Ave. 

I’ve since moved to Pittsburgh but every time I come back to visit family I stop there before I go to my families house. Lmao. | A Detroit style coney diner. Or even someplace that serves regular ass biscuits and gravy and not hipster heirloom 1000 layer laminated biscuits and gravy that costs >$24 | CoCo Ichibanya 🍛 Haven’t had Japanese/Japanese-style curry in the city that lives up | New Mexico style Southwestern cuisine. Just dumping Hatch chilies over a plate doesn't count. | Loco Moco!

And none of this fancy stuff where places try and make it ""more Hawaiian"" by adding pineapple or Spam or mac salad.

Just a plain ol' Loco Moco - rice, beef patty, egg, and gravy. | wish there were some proper sit down/fine dining pakistani restaurants | Pit Beef from Baltimore.  God what I would do for a halfway decent pit beef stand. | We need professional & traditional Haitian food in Manhattan that’s reasonably priced. The city needs legim ak diri sos pwa!!!! | Fried crickets | Moroccan food is incredible, and there are a variety of dishes Americans love (tagines, couscous, stewed meats and light desserts), but it's hard to find a good Moroccan restaurant in the city.  There was one in the East Village that was decent, but not sure if it's still there. | Breakfast tacos, kolcahes, chips n queso | Breakfast tacos.  Only a few random spots have them | Brisket/brisket mac n cheese

DIY stir fry places like BDs Mongolian bbq 🤤

It’s not an authentic dish but arroz con pollo where it’s got chicken, rice, and queso

Also any Mexican alternatives to Chipotle. Dos toros sucks and is cold and chipotle doesn’t hit and is too expensive for what it is. I need qdoba here

Also good soft serve is hard to find. Mr Softee tastes like water based rather than cream

Cheap chicken biscuit breakfast sammies that aren’t homophobic

Beignets. I know of one place to get them, ray’s candy, and it’s sooo good but it’s not very common to find. I also went far out of my way to File gumbo bar for high end ones

Bbq beef ribs!! A treat and impossible to find. Au Jus says they do but they never have. | Egg, bacon or sausage patty and cheese on a HOMEMADE BISCUIT 😋 The most delicious breakfast sandwich I ever consumed in life. Kansas City has them 😊 | San Francisco Mission burritos. When friends move to the east coast, I have to freeze and ship to them. | Persian | Kansai-style sukiyaki, somebody please prove me wrong | Pho | GOOD Iranian and Georgian | good iranian and georgian | Buffalo wings and ""grinders"". 
Passable wings are few and far between 
And while there are good sandwiches. The grinders don't slap. Matter of fact just getting the bread to do it yourself is even difficult.  Wish there were more bread bakeries. | Subanik. It’s a Guatemalan tomato-based stew flavored with various spicy and sweet peppers as well as onion, garlic, with beef, pork, and chicken. 

I had it twice in Antigua, Guatemala and it just may be the best thing I’ve ever eaten.

https://growingupbilingual.com/subanik-recipe-a-delicious-stew-from-guatemala/ | I miss Great Jones Cafe for some Cajun inspired sides and Streetbird Chicken for Southern sides. They both had dishes that took me back to my grandmothers table. I find the Vietnamese to be lacking but sometimes find a good spot.  | I’ve been all over searching for Hotteok (Korean street pancakes), no one seems to really do them. Ktown and Murray Hill have places with them on the menu but the ones I’ve been to don’t actually serve them or serve something that doesn’t really resemble what you’d get on the street in Korea. | Thai roti dessert. 

Real alcapurrias like in pr,  not that bs they try to pass off here.

Cracked conch.

Not a meal, but who serves a lafitte's worthy hurricane? | Good everyday Cuban. I was so spoiled in Florida | Wow reading this thread makes it seem like New York food is all cap. 

With all millions of options it dilutes the quality average in general. From my experience in Manhattan at least there was a clear lack of Vietnamese food. I need to try Non La. | Tex-mex | Bbq. I know ow there are a few spots but nothing has knocked my socks off. | Queso | A proper shawarma god dammit! | Good bbq is still sorely lacking imo, more Southern style, Tex Mex, Cajun, and Toasted Ravioli (iykyk) | There’s a really good applebees on 234 w 42nd street | Good Vietnamese food unfortunately does not exist in NYC.  I’ve had much better pho in Eastern Europe than I have here 😔 additionally, legit Cambodian food hardly exists here (there are only two Cambodian restaurants in NYC, and one of them is very overpriced and not authentic). | I think NYC has shitty BBQ food | Still looking for authentic Poutine. | I haven’t been able to find good Caribbean food, authentic Chinese food, or tacos anywhere. | Chicken,Curry,Dinner•$$$

* 94 Good food
* 89 On time delivery
* 90 Correct order | Gumbo Bros. (RIP) was good. Now Lowerline and Holywater do the best in the city IMO. Pricey, but good. | KJUN is fantastic. Korean and Cajun fusion, so not 100% authentic per se, but incredible nonetheless | 1803 in Tribeca has great gumbo & jambalaya among other Cajun inspired dishes… super lively atmosphere with a central bar and they have a live jazz band every night - definitely recommend! | Lowerline is probably the closest you'll get. | Roses R&R in Williamsburg has a pop up kitchen and the chef is from New Orleans. Fantastic gumbo, po’boys, and fried shrimp. | I would say in general real soul food is lacking. Like there are a few spots here and there. But most of it is actually Caribbean food with some ""soul inspired"" dishes. | Yes! As a New Orleans native living in NYC I miss Gumbo, etouffee and Jambalaya. There is a definite lack. | It's wild to me how difficult it is to find remotely authentic Cajun or Creole dishes outside of the New Orleans area. The dishes aren't exactly wildly complex, and they don't use rare ingredients. | i used to go to the delta grill. I like Alligator Pear but nothing's like NOLA | Filé Gumbo Bar in Tribeca 👌 | Sugar Freak in Astoria is pretty good! Their gumbo wasn’t life changing, but it’s pretty good for satisfying that craving. | Those dishes, but any good Poboys in general. Parish poboys at Smorgasburg is the closest. 

The only other I tried was Sugar Freak, it was awful. They gave my husband a crawfish platter that I can mostly describe as a soup saying “this is how they do in Nola”, and trying to pass off donut holes as beignets. We both grew up near the city and I’ve never seen a crawfish platter served like that. | every year i try to find kings cake and never do | Fort Lee has three Korean - Cajun boil places that I’m aware of. Two of them, Capt. Loui and Dancing Camaron are pretty good even if not 100% authentic. | Cooking with Jazz in Queens was pretty spectacular but they’re long gone | Gumbo, I can find.

Jambalaya, on the other hand, is almost non-existent. | didn't Mara's Homemade re-open? | Came here to say exactly this. I was born in Louisiana but grew up in Texas. I just decided to learn to cook it myself in the end and the effort feels really worth it considering I feel like I basically can’t buy it here.  | Venture out to Jamaica, Queens. Plenty of solid Cajun places. | Filé in Tribeca. Amazing | I’m Balkan and imo, the best and most authentic one is Kafana in the East Village. Selo is okay, it depends on the day you go. Terasa in Williamsburg is just okay too, and Cevabdzinica Sarajevo is downright terrible with the worst meat I’ve ever had. | Also came to say Astoria has at least 2 Doner Kebab a places. A new one just opened. | Also good Albanian places in the Bronx | Bronx for Albanian food. | > but Selo is also good.

According to this week's rumor mill, apparently not renewing their lease. | Sarajevo is great. | What's a guy gotta do to get a Portillo's out here?

They ran a truck one weekend a year or two ago, I was hopeful that they were looking to open here. But so far, nothing. | I’m sure it’s not really up to par with Chicago but Dog Day Afternoon (had the one in H&H) and Bobbi’s Italian Beef are pretty good | I thought Dog Day Afternoon (brick and mortar in Windsor Terrace) was pretty on par with the ones I’ve eaten in Chicago | I watched the bear and asked my Chicago neighbor what was the big deal about Italian beef. I didnt understand how that cut of beef thrown on a sopping wet piece of bread was going to be good. 

Went to Emmett’s ordered the thin crust pizza and an Italian beef. The sandwhich was sooo good i ordered a 2nd one and have gone back since just for the sandwhich. The thin cracker like pizza i do not understand and don’t care to. | My people! 


Emmett's is good for the tavern style pizza and I think Bobbi's on Brooklyn has the best Italian beef in the city. Tavern Pizza is good too  | Bobbi's Italian beef! | Fiore's in Hoboken is worth the trip. | I’ll still say Hawaiian- just got back from LA and went to Rutts 2 days in a row to get my fix… Saimin, Kailua pork omelettes, Spam Musubi and burger plate lunches wherefore art thou? | No ka ‘oi! | damn, walked past it but was in a rush so didnt stop by

it's good? were you around when it was in FIDI years back? | Omg thank you for posting this I’ve been missing L&L so much 😭 | Omg I can’t believe I’m not the only one who’s done this. Nandos would kill in nyc | I've actually called the corporate office and asked about opening a franchise in NYC and they said they have no plans of opening in New York, That being said there is a decent Nando's style peri peri place not that far outside the city in East Rutherford, NJ. It hits the spot when missing Nando's. | Trying to upvote you back up. If we can have the glorious Times Square Olive Garden, then surely there is room for a cheeky Nando’s! | How the fuck did Austin get a Nandoos before NYC | God yes please, someone swap out one of these hot chicken places for peri peri please. Luckily have a decent peri peri place in the NJ suburbs near us, but shocked there is nothing near Midtown (there are a couple in East Village but haven’t tried those). | Toronto? Sure!
Chicago? Sure! 
Austin? Sure!
Largest city and US and Canada? Nah go fuck yourself. | How come the DC/VA area gets all the Nandos love?!?! | DC resident here: Nando’s has not travelled well over here. It’s miles better back in the UK. | Frango's Peri Peri in East Village. I love Nandos, but I think Frango's is even better. | I was just about to post this. We need a Nando’s! | A cheeky nando’s | I've been to the Nando's in Chicago (years ago though) and it wasn't very much like Nando's in the UK. | YESSSS NANDOS. I will happy sign any petition to request they expand to NY. | username truly checks out | What is pommes mayo? Just fries w/ good mayo? Or something more specific?

Have you given Pommes Frites a shot?  Or is Belgian style too disparate? | I like Radegast beer hall but last time I got currywurst there the sausage was barely warmed on the grill. They cook them then they sit precooked until you order then they’re supposed to reheat it but rushed it so badly. There wasn’t even a line or anything, really disappointing | DSK is pretty solid. | What is NRW style? | There’s a bratwurst stand in the Bryant Park Winter Village that has currywurst. Only tried the bratwurst so far, but I was quite a fan of it and the people running it are actually German (unless I’m misinterpreting their accent) | You mean NQRW style | Yeah, there’s a lot of European food missing in the city IMO | didn't there used to be a currywurst place in the EV? | Max Bratwurst in Astoria (Sunnyside?) has a great currywurst. | Have you tried Radegast Hall? Pricey but decent | The currywurst in Bryant Park winter village tastes Ike the one I had in Frankfurt! | Agreed — I miss Western NY for about 3 reasons and wings are one of them.

Wogie’s in the financial district has the best wings I’ve found in the city (to your point, I believe the owners are from Philly). There is one in the west village as well, but it’s weirdly not as good. | I like Blondies’ wings | Blondies in the UWS honestly does stellar wings. Give it a go if you haven’t yet; Mondays are $1/wing specials | Bklyn Burro makes me sad.

It says ""SF style burrito"" on the glass, so they know what they're trying to be, and they so very aren't. | Need bar-bill in nyc (best wings in the world in buffalo) | Plug Uglies (Formerly Bar Coastal) in the UES has fantastic wings | Ever been to Bonnie’s in Park Slope for buffalo wings? | Hard to find a good pho | > Anything Southern

Agreed, and everytime I come across a new place to try, its always ""elevated"" southern cuisine at places that look too fancy and charge too much, or has traditional dishes altered to appease to more of a northeastern palate. I just want biscuits and sausage gravy (with tons of black pepper and sage) at a laidback diner-style place where they don't serve flutes of champagne. | Especially biscuits. Never had a decent one in the city. Not even close. | The best mexican food I've have came out of hole in the wall delis in Sunset Park, Brooklyn or Jackson Heights, Queens | You have to pick and choose your Mexican and know where to go....lots of places that had great Mexican food either show now love or cut costs becuase things are expensive and it shows in the food. | Sorely missing a solid meat and three! | I’m from SoCal  and I agree with all of this! | Not a huge or strong viet population in NY. I travel to Philly for great viet food. | Go to El Barrio, Mexican is top notch there.  Ollin on E 108th is amazing, so is Taco Mix on E 116th | For southern, if you’re looking for chicken biscuits Pies n Thighs in Williamsburg hits | Yes! Soul food here sucks!! | Tacos are as good as SF/LA. Williamsburg/greenpoint have a few really good options. | Yesss the Mexican food is just ok and I’m always surprised it’s not better | There’s some fantastic Vietnamese in the Bronx | Los tacos #1 amigo | Ursula in bed stuy has the fire breakfast burritos | Diablito in the EV does a decent one. | Kings Kolache in Bushwick has really good breakfast tacos, but they are pricey, though. | Seriously | Grand Canyon Diner in Park Slope | Hawksmoor too on Sundays | Lord's in Greenwich Village | Jones Wood Foundry? Haven’t had the roast but other things and it was pretty good. | Does Tea & Sympathy in the Village have it? They have an amazing Shepherd's Pie. | I've never been for the roast before, but maybe Jones Wood Foundry on UES. | I think Dead Rabbit does one, but maybe it's not every week | I’ve never had it but I see churchills advertising it every time I’m there. Everything I’ve eaten there has been solid. | Churchill's Tavern does a sunday roast. Can't speak to how it is though. | Should we start our own chaat stall? | Have you tried honest vegetarian? | I had pani puri at Dhaba the other night for the first time. | Yep, have to make the hike down to Journal Square. | Not the traditional Spanish paella you’re probably hoping for, but the Kimchi Paella at Thursday Kitchen is phenomenal | Maybe Cafe Salamanca in Jackson Heights. Haven’t been in years so can’t say if it still holds up | I haven’t had it, but I know Soccarat exists | I like boqueria. | There’s a paella popup called arroces I hear is good | Boqueria | Mercado in Hudson Yards has amazing Spanish food I was genuinely impressed by everything I ate there. Never had the paella there though. Might be worth a shot. 

Otherwise I love the Paella at a Westchester place called Basque. | I like el pote | All the food at Soccarat is amazing, including their paella | Haven’t had a paella since I left the Dominican Republic. There is a small Spanish community that makes the real deal. I’ll take a look at everybody’s suggestions.

And speaking of paella, the FDA is fuzzy about some cheeses and sausages from Europe. So we’re missing a lot of those imported foods. | For Döner 
Turks In  in Bushwick 
Kotti Berliner in downtown Brooklyn & east village 
DönerHaus in Astoria 

German (Bavarian in particular) food Zum Stammtisch in queens is a childhood fav. Max Bratwurst in queens too. 
Cafe Katja (Austrian) in the east village | Have you seen anywhere in NYC serving Maultaschen? | German style Doner really takes a back seat to Shawarma in NYC. | Der Pioneer in Kensington is a pastry focused German bakery but they make bread as well. Right around the corner from that is Werkstatt - they are an Austrian restaurant. | Breadsmith of Brooklyn in Midwood is what you want. I am originally from the Netherlands and it was the first loaf I really enjoyed here. | Yes plz come to NYC | Cheeky | Barbecue is a good answer, however it’s difficult to do well in a city like NYC. You need a lot of outdoor space. | I was just talking to a friend yesterday about this and the BBQ culture is not here in NY. We need more transplants who are passionate about BBQ | What about Dinosaur BBQ? I thought it was good. | I'll come over and cook you some if u want <3 

Sometimes you just gotta make it yourself.

Homemade molasses bbq sauce w ribs cooked on a grill or in a Dutch oven is going to be pretty close to your favorite slow cooked southern bbq ribs (ok not exactly the same but you can get pretty close) | John brown BBQ in LIC | Am I the only one who thought hometown bbq was painfully mid? I have heard they have on/off days | Queens has plenty of authentic cuisine from lots of parts of the world, but definitely not all and especially not what the city is lacking in general: regional American, many European cuisines, etc. | Not arguing with your statement, but it’s a non sequitur. You can’t find great bbq anywhere in NYC | Theres diversity of food but not depth. Just bc you can find food from a country doesnt mean theres variety to that food. Each country ,like the us, has its regional differences and specialty meals. Not one of my foreign born friends feels their countries food is that good or well represented in nyc. The restaurants serve a few popular dishes that have easy to come by ingredients. And many of the restaurants make the food lackluster in queens bc they know the people from their country will eat it anyway bc its all there is. The exception being chinese food which you can find a better amount of variety but theres still many dishes you cant find. | Santa Fe in Williamsburg makes green chile breakfast burritos you buy from a take out window | I love Anita’s so so much. 

I can’t believe DC has better New Mexican food than NYC. | Because breakfast burritos are not Mexican food or have anything to do with Mexico! | Fellow NOVA transplant here and I miss Anita’s! | Yea some (not all) like the person who said Filipino food isn't accessible by train when there's Woodside right off the 7 train. Or that Southeast Asian food is hard to find when Queens exists. | Javelina is the only place in the city that even does free unlimited chips and salsa! The food is ok. | Yellow Rose is pretty good. | People will suggest Javelina and Yellow Rose but they're NewYorkified, stylized. Doesnt quite get it done for me as a former Texan. I just make it at home and its 1/5 the price. Kellogs was revamped but I havent gone yet. I'm praying for a place with semi-decent migas | The revamped menu at Kelloggs Diner is texmex focused and the chef is originally from RGV - it's legit | Cowgirl. Yee haw | boromir069 clearly has never been to Jackson Heights | This has been my recent quest and its been sad | Masalawala and Sons? I got the Thali vegetarian lunch platter and it was great. | Where are you looking? There are tons of restaurants that serve that in every borough. | what are we talking about here? like chole bhature? or more homecooked style dishes like aloo mattar, sabzis etc | There’s no lack of this in Jackson Heights. Angel is my go to for vegetarian though, their saag paneer is perfection. | Honestly there's a reason Dutch food is not that popular, it's not very good | Well, it has been about 500 years since the Dutch were in charge, and it's not like NYC has been static since it was New Amsterdam and only existed south of Wall. | Croquettes were the only thing I missed from studying abroad there. 

Some of indonesian food was pretty good, but not my favorite type of SE asian food

going to an automaat and getting croquettes will forever be etched into my brain | Still searching for kapsalon. BXL has decent patatje met but that’s about it. Haring at Russ and daughters.  | My Persian friends rave about Eyval and Sofreh. What did/didn't you like? | Ravagh is fantastic! | Yes! I'm Persian and while those restaurants are good, people don't know how diverse Persian food can really be, and *a lot* of people don't know how diverse Persian food is in itself; aka there's a lot of food from nearby countries featured in Persian food, and a lot of street food, home cooking, that isn't really featured here.


I. Want. Kotlets. | You gotta go to Great Neck, NY outside of Queens. 
Good Persian community/population there too. 
Check out Shiraz & Colbeh | Ravagh is totally legit. No complaints from this Persian | As a Taiwanese person I agree. It will scratch the itch when I need it. I will give them credit for that. | Connect the dots please? | I miss that I can get rice ball from Houston at reasonable price | It's been done: Döner Haus | Have you been to Noreetuh in East Village? It's high end, but they do magical things with Spam. | Theyre opening a 2 L&L. One  in Harlem and one in the LES | Hanoi House has bun cha though I haven’t tried. Saigon Social also has bun cha on their menu, not incredibly authentic but quite decent | We had Madiba for a while 😔 | We need a biltong shop! | Gotta go to ozone for trini not gonna find anything in Manhattan | there was a great place on kenmare for a few years. only did unagi on rice, shockingly expensive, worth it every time.

live eels prepped fresh every day. i miss it so much. | like unagi-don? not really sure what you mean by a proper unagi meal | I like the Unagi don and Unatamadon at Benemon a lot | There used to be 3 places, all gone during covid.  Kanoyama used to kill their Anagos to order, but they're made ahead of time.  Ootoya has a decent unadon.  Their eels seem better than the 40 dollar frozen ones from Kagoshima, you can get in Japanese groceries. | You're right. Why is this impossible for diners? Is the grill not hot enough? Do they not get the water out of the potatoes first? Diner potatoes stink here. | Djerdan in Astoria has great burek. | Edy's grocer in Greenpoint? | Yeah. I never had a good Baião-de-dois in NY. There are a few good Brazilian restaurants, like Berimbau, but they rarely have regional dishes. 

NYC is also missing good traditional Brazilian dishes like Stroganoff, Kibbeh, Sfiha, and pizza 😂 | Yeah I don’t think it exists in the city. | Bark Barbecue is Texas style bbq with strong Dominican influence in its flavors that really take it to the next level IMO! Highly recommend! | Hometown in Red Hook is really good but ugh the trek. | The main thing that throws Mexican food off here is the fact that produce is grown out west. By the time it gets here it straight up isn’t fresh anymore comprising the flavor. Only way out of it is to not buy produce wholesale and do it locally which ramps up the cost and then they do “elevated” Mexican to justify the prices | Texmex and Calimex are almost completely missing, traditional Mexican food is still worse than other cities. | Ollin in East Harlem | Check out Casa Enrique in LIC | A lot has changed in 15 days keep up | Have you ever tried the places in elmhurst? Its on my list but havent gotten to it yet. | ever heard of New York Indonesian Food bazaar? | Does anyone city in the US do Indonesian well ? | My coworker is burmese and told me theres many places in elmhurst that arent even clearly listed online. Theres burmese stores in broadway mall and theres a sunday only burmese restaurant inside another restaurant at 8317 broadway. They also sometimes do food events at the local churches on broadway. | Tangra is great! | elmhurst definitely. 

New York Indonesian Food Bazaar is a pop up food bazaar that has incredible indo about 1x per month | Parsi food is even hard to find in India outside of Bombay! It’s soooo good. | a salt and battery was terrible when I had it, fish just disintegrated in my mouth | I found a delicious fish and chips shop last year. Went maybe 5 times only to find it shuttered like a month later. I'm still so upset. | Melting pot’s cheddar beer fondue recipe is free online and takes 10 minutes to make. Best at home date night and cheap once you buy the pot the first time.

Agree it’s weird there aren’t any places for it when hot pot is so popular and NYC definitely has the market for a fancy fondue shop.  | There are tons of these places all over queens. Try Pio Pio like the other commenter said or Caravan Chicken in Astoria. | Pio Pio lunch special

Claudy's in the Bronx. | Coming from the DC area, this is something I've really been missing | Chirp scratches the itch | that exists quite largely all over the city. i just passed by like 3 in manhattan on my way to work dude | has anyone tried the spot in Essex Market? I'm always curious, but it's definitely not that cheap | As someone else said, check out Queens. There’s pío pío (they have the best green sauce), pollos Mario, Warique, and Urubamba just in JH alone. The most affordable one is The Original American Chicken, you can get a half chicken and two sides I think for $14-15. Not quite as good as some of the others, but still hits the spot. | Lol there’s so many of these it’s kind of annoying for when I am searching for good non-chicken peruvian food | [deleted] | If you're looking for Burmese food, here's some recommended ones

- Burmese Bites
- Little Myanmar
- Rangoon
- Asian Bowl

(all accessible by train) | Have you been to Woodside for Filipino food? There’s literally a whole area called “Little Manila” full of Filipino restaurants and bakeries. And of course a jollibee haha. | If you go to queens night market there’s a ton of SEA options | Come by the East Village/Greenwich Village. There are literal dozens of great Vietnamese places, from Viet BBQ to pho to bun bo hue. A few of many, many options:

Nón Lá (bun bo hue) 

Saigon Shack (great everyday pho, shrimp/pork/spring roll bun)

Madame Vo (BBQ)

Sao Mai (they've gone downhill a bit, but I still like their banh xeo)

Hanoi House (more high end/gentrified Hanoi-style pho, long-simmered broth) | you should get out more. sunset park, queens, and even the bronx all have excellent mexican food. | Some Thai Restaurant in queens offer them in Thai version with big roll rice noodle soup.  Bo Ky in Manhattan came very close with mixed country braised internal guts. | Cafe Mogodor | We started making our own labneh at home—pretty easy and even though we still get it whenever we see it on a menu, what we make is better. We get our pita from an Egyptian market (we’re in Astoria) but I would love some large warm fresh Druze pita | because it’s not a real thing indian people eat and was probably invented to cater to that demographic | Man, I miss Gumbo Bros. and their prices were so reasonable, too! I realize it’s a labor intensive dish, but everywhere I’ve found for delivery is ridiculously expensive for a super small portion. | I love lowerline.  Need to go back | With a name like Lowerline they are ironically setting the bar pretty high. 😎 | Ate here last night, that fried chicken was fire. Great pickles too | Can confirm. That creole food has saved my life | Agreed. Someone else on a separate thread on this post mentioned the lack of true Southern cuisine, too, so this tracks. | Right? I spent 10 years in Chicago and even they had a more vibrant Cajun and Creole food scene. | Honestly. But the plus side of that is I’ve learned how to make a pretty great gumbo and jambalaya on my own (I use bacon fat for the gumbo roux). Would love to try other Cajun and Creole recipes because it’s a lot of fun to cook | I had the best off menu braised short ribs at Delta Grill and I’ve been chasing that dragon ever since. | I’m shocked Sugar Freak is still open. I went there long ago and felt it wasn’t good at all even if I didn’t compare it to food from New Orleans. Never went back but still see it recommended often. Maybe me and my friend got all the wrong items lol | I would like to disagree but they've been there for long enough that I might be wrong. | Same. I once called several bakeries to ask, and a couple of them actually thought I was a prank caller. | Just order one from Gambinos. We get a few a year, it isn’t cheap bc it’s overnight but it’s like being back home for a few days. We lose our bread knife to the box for the two days until it’s gone. | Another vote for Kafana here. Also, it was on a NY Times ‘Top 100 best New York Restaurants’  list for the last year. | Most people in the Chicago Reddit say that Portillo is a shell of its former self and not worth eating. | Amazing musubi at Noreetuh + bomb loco moco & mac salad. Chef is from Honolulu. | Have you tried the L&L? They have they basically have all those things.  Not the Kailua pork omelette but they have a pork plate | The Fidi one wasn't so great lol. Think the staff were already checked out when I went. Quality on Allen is similar to an L&L on the West Coast that's competently managed. | Oh my god yes. Just as Chick Fil A is would kill in the UK. 

I went to one there that opened as a test, but they didn’t have spicy chicken | Thank you for your service to this fine city. | Olive Garden is just its own type of legend. It's really Jollibee we should be comparing a potential Nando's presence to. | DC has two lol | Frango's Peri Peri in East Village. I love Nandos, but I think Frango's is even better. | What’s the place in jersey | I agree but it sure does hit the spot!  It's better to have DC-caliber Nando's than no Nando's at all! | ya i've gotten from here before, hits the spot

but also now that TJs sells their version, honestly just getting some rotisserie chicken + sauce gets you like 80% there | The mayo used for German fries (pommes) & mayo that you get from a wurst stand is “salatmayo”. It’s more like Miracle Whip than traditional mayonnaise, but not Miracle Whip. 

If you get fries and mayo at a proper restaurant, it will be real mayo, but that’s probably not what you’re looking for when you get it at a grab and go place, food truck or stand. 

I haven’t been to Pommes Frite since before Covid, and I remember it being close, reminded me of Mannekin Pis in Amsterdam with all their sauces. Looking at recent Google pics, it looks like they now have some fresh cut fries, which is not what I’m looking for. | Nordrhein Westfalen or North Rhine Westphalia is a state in western Germany with Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Bonn, Köln (Cologne) and Wuppertal as its major cities. 

The default sausage served in a currywurst platter varies region by region in Germany. In NRW (or Dortmund area (“im Pott”), it’s a coarsely ground pork, lightly seasoned, in casing; looks grey or light brown when raw and grills generally the same color. 

In other parts of Germany, it may be a delicate weisswurst (where pork is pureed before being put in casing), or bockwurst (which is more like an American hot dog). | When I move back to Germany and open a restaurant with American classics, this will be among the names I consider. Thanks!! | RIP UES Blondies. | I kind of like Bklyn Burro. Feel like it’s solid without trying to do too much. Also their salsas send me to the pain zone which I like. | I make cathead biscuits from scratch, in a cast iron skillet, and my husband makes a killer sausage gravy the way you describe. (Louisiana native, and he spent his summers in Louisiana growing up.) 

Sounds like a bunch of us need to get together and do our own pot luck. I’d love to do a crawfish boil. 😭 | I would kill for a Times Square Cracker Barrel ngl  | there is phenomenal mexican food in both neighborhoods. | Found it very mediocre tbh. Was more impressed by the environs. | Sadly not really comparable to either a proper pub roast or a Sunday roast cooked at home | Ha.  I just suggested that place too. | Yes | havent! worth it? | Zum Stammtisch looks great but it’s in Glendale. Is that the one you mean? | Honestly no, which is sad :( I love them in soup or pan fried ugh so good | Or very good scrubbers, which is part of what made Blue Smoke famous when it first opened.  They had to put a lot of effort into purifying their air output.  Too bad the actual BBQ was kinda meh. | BBQ everywhere now has to be really good to be worth. Like a lot of cuisines what was once a poverty food is now trendy. I'd fully expect a 1/4lb of brisket, cornbread, a side and a beer to cost like $45. | Its less about passion and more about practicalities - BBQ takes time and makes smoke. Time means you need space to prepare enough food for volume service. Smoke means you need to be away from other buildings or have expensive air filtration. The result is that BBQ, which in many other parts of the country can be a cheap set of smokers on a lot with some picnic tables and be excellent, becomes a very expensive investment to do in NYC.

Its bad enough that several NYC BBQ restaurants are known for doing their actual smoking in NJ and trucking the cooked meat into the city. Thats cheaper than doing in-city smoking, but still drives up cost on what people largely expect to be inexpensive food. | Holy shit haven't heard the name Dinosaur since I was a little kid! My parents always raved about it and now I'll have to hop back up to Harlem to check it out. Thanks for reminding me | I think Dinosaur is underrated. Especially their ribs. I also find the one in Harlem to be better than the one in Gowanus. | Can you say a little more about regional American cuisines? I live in a bubble, I seriously don't know shit about anything beyond the northeast and even then, not so much outside the tristate | Facts. People will of course reply with whatever name and proclaim the BBQ at X place is great when it isn’t lol.

Every BBQ place is a disappointment in NYC if you know top end BBQ. It’s just simple as that unfortunately. | I have a totally opposite experience with my family & friends who are born abroad, but that's personal experience for ya! That said, it's mostly Chinese, Turkish, and Colombians so who knows about other cuisines, I couldn't say. Can you tell me a little about the food your friends didn't like? So curious | Plenty of other places do free chips n salsa | Thank you! | Omg Migas. I miss those too. When I check out Kellogs, since it’s been revamped, I’ll save this thread and post an update … for my fellow Texas transplant ❤️ | Been to couple around the city like a2b and ananda (pure vegetarian shops w no meat) and the only one that really feels authentic to me is the Hindu temple canteen in Flushing | Those restaurants all serve the same type of Indian restaurant food, like the kind you'd go get at a restaurant even if you're in India. It's not authentic Indian food and nowhere close to the diversity of Indian food.  | I enjoy it. But I grew up on some of it. A late night Dutch snack shop would be glorious. | Two of the best restaurants in New York | Exactly! My partner is Persian & there is so much diversity in the food. It’s really lacking in NYC. | Talking about ho foods😂. They cater to the hipster clientele. Taiwanese breakfast food is cheap but this place is selling you a breakfast set with just carbs for $40. The food isn’t bad but for the price you won’t frequent it. | Yeah, I've tried them both.  Hanoi House made me mad with how expensive and paltry it was.  The first time I went to Saigon Social it had promise, but on a repeat visit, I realized it still didn't hit the spot.

My favorite so far is probably La Dong near Union Square.  Still not my favorite, but I went when they first opened, and you could tell the owner cared about doing right by Vietnamese food.  I'd be curious to try it again. | It's a meal I get every time I'm in Japan. | Yep, I only visit as a tourist or for work and have often thought it would be a great thing to go to in December after looking around the Xmas displays | Cool will do. Thank you! | The Filipino food in NYC doesn't even come close to the variety and depth of Filipino stuff you can get in California unfortunately. Tito Rad's and Renee's are good, but the food that you find in Queens is very focused on lutong bahay and barbecue. Mamafina's is a good sisigan too, if a little expensive. 

But there's no good spots for beef pares, no places that focus on kakanin, no places for actually cheap silogs, no places I can think of that even serve stuff like paella, arroz valenciana, etc. the complicated mixed rice dishes from home, absolutely zero kilawin/kinilaw spots outside of like... Tsismis and Tradisyon which aren't really focusing on kinilaw, absolutely zero spots which focus on traditionally vegetarian Filipino dishes like laing, minanok, adobong langka, langka paksiw, etc. | No, but I will check it out the next time I’m there. Love Jollibee’s though. Unmistakably, for me, the best fast food fried chicken! With the adobo rice!? *chef’s kiss* | They are good but all the places just serve basically what youve listed. When I was in houston they had so much variety, vietnamese style shaved ice and made to order desserts shop, viet breakfast like bo ne, other soups I  never see here. Devastating. And since paris sandwich closed where can i get fresh vietnamese baguettes | If you can point me to a restaurant with a good pumpkin seed mole, I would be thrilled. | I loved their cornbread 😭 | Its not good | Agree, they're quality has gone down quite a bit :( | Worked there 15 years ago. Would generally agree. It's still good for certain nostalgic purposes but I can't recommend it in the same way I did back then. | Minor gripe as a Chicagoan of 15 years:

Portillos isn't even a ""Chicago"" thing, it's a ""Chicago suburbs"" thing. Until very recently there was only one Portillos in the entire city of Chicago and it was in basically the most touristy area of the city. It's gone downhill somewhat but it was always built to go downhill. It's a suburban pastiche of Chicago, not a ""real Chicago"" thing.

Most Chicagoans in my experience rarely if ever go to Portillos. There's a million other italian beef spots in the city. Same wavelength as also acknowledging, like, Chicagoans almost never actually eat deep dish pizza. It's a very touristy gimmick. Most pizza places make what's typically called ""Chicago tavern style"" and that's what most Chicagoans eat. | Funny enough one of the chefs who opened is a good friend's cousin so went to the opening and a few times after. It's very good but smallish portions and fancier. But again, very good. | Not the new one but many times in SoCal - not bad just more fast food style than places like Rutts which is more Diner or Cafe style. But will def try soon : ) | DC has 6, with 4 more just outside the city | The chicken itself isn’t that good but the sauces are killer | Triboros Peri Peri | Or better yet, get together and open an authentic southern, “affordable” restaurant!! I can make the greens and potato salad!!  | Right. I'm tired of hearing this ""NYC doesn't have good Mexican"" trope. | I thought it was good. | Me too | Its not all chaat but vada pav slaps, tried a few other things and was happy | Yup that’s queens | And most great BBQ restaurants (mostly in the south and Midwest) are not going to randomly create a location in NYC in which they would have to take so many business risks vs just opening an additional one closer to them. 

If they were to open up a location deep enough in Queens / Brooklyn, it might be too far off for tourists that many new restaurants depend on for business. | Lots of various regional BBQ, specific regional dishes from all over the country (like we’ve seen Detroit style pizza become in vogue and it’s something you can easily get here but there are all sorts of dishes/cuisines from all over the country). I’d love Seattle-style teriyaki or someone made the point that we don’t have great Cajun options as just two examples. | You need a red state to make good barbecue. Not my politics but if I see a thin blue line in the window I know I’ll have some great brisket | When I went to the Netherlands the only thing I liked was the Bitterballen and the cheese. Beer was also alright | Don't get me wrong, the basics are covered *beautifully* but there's a *lot* of home made variations. That's what I want to see. (Also it's really overpriced let's be real here). 


If I could get two kotlets on a proper pita with some cucumber yogurt and red onions and sabzi Id just squeal with delight. | Thank you!! Wasn’t trying to snark just genuinely didn’t know which place they were referring to :) | Kabayan and Ihawan are my top two restaurants. Tito Rad’s is also worth checking out. Purple Dough is also a super cute little bakery with all the ube things! | If you ever come out to the Bay Area, Ca and you love Viet food, you HAVE to visit San Jose! | la morada in the bronx used to have a bunch of different mole-been a while for me so i'm not sure what they are doing these days

claro in brooklyn is on the fancy side but runs an amazing mole verde

i see pipian verde on a bunch of menus but i'm usually ordering antojitos (sopes, picaditas, etc.) so its sort of off my radar. | I’ve lived in Chicago for twelve years and I’ve been exactly once, and it was of course out in the burbs. Not in my top 100 places to go here | Or a food truck. I’ve got the grits, homemade banana pudding (real homemade custard; none of that instant pudding crap), peach cobbler, green beans, pecan pie, and bananas foster covered. 

Beignets, poboys, red beans and rice w andouille sausage, southern style “dressin’, chicken spaghetti, fried catfish, fried dill pickles, corn bread, chicken n dumplings, corn maque choux, dirty rice, chicken livers gizzards n hearts, butter beans, fried green tomatoes. Much of it isn’t very labor intensive or expensive to make. Could have rotating menu depending on ingredient sourcing.

I’ve wanted to do this for a while but I also know it’s incredibly exhausting work. | Coming from LA, I've gone to every major neighborhood with a large Mexican population in the city and have yet to find a great place. Some are ok but none excellent. I'm excluding expensive modern Mexican places in Manhattan and north BK. I would love to know what I'm missing. | I wanted it to be good! I'm not a Hawksmoor regular so maybe I went on an off day.

I suppose it passed for a pretty normal Sunday roast and my expectations were off after the recommendations on the sub. A Sunday roast is a Sunday roast. | What about the marijuana?! :P | Sooooo overpriced | I don't think the best Mexican places are exclusively in Mexican heavy neighborhoods. A really solid spot in the East Village just opened up called Carnitas Ramirez (seriously go) from the people who own the also really popular Taqueria Ramirez in Greenpoint. These places stand up to anything I've had in Mexico or LA/SD/SF | depends what you like-nyc is mostly pueblan and the one advantage la has is more regional cuisines. i regularly eat things in brooklyn or queens that are as good as i can get in mexico or la, both places i've traveled to and lived in. picaditas, sopes, huaraches, tlacoyos, tortas, cemitas and tacos at the right places can all be excellent.

try the chilaquiles rojos at ricos tacos in sunset park or some of the vendors under the 7 train at 103 corona. or chalupas poblanas el tlecuile. | It’s fine. Also the Dutch don’t eat it | Thanks man. I just got back from CDMX and I've got a strong craving. Will check it out. | Yes! We’re in JackHeights and my husband is Mexican. We moved here for the food ;-)"
"West Village Dinner, no reservations","I have a friend from out of town coming in and staying with me. We're planning to go to the Comedy Cellar and want to grab dinner beforehand, and I have no reservations. Where could we go? There are 3 of us, no $ restrictions, but also not looking for anything extravagant, and would like to keep it under 90 minutes.

**Edit:** Thank you so much everyone! These are great suggestions and there are so many in here that I hadn't even heard of. I'll send these to my friend and take our pick. I'll share which one we end up going to!","Maybe you can walk in a the bar at minetta depending on the time. | Pinto garden  

Piccolo angelo might be possible depending on the day  

Bobo | Rosemary's | Il Totano is relatively new and seriously underrated, and seems like they always have room these days | Saigon Shack | malatesta | Pop into Cauldron chicken. It’s so good. Super casual won’t take long to eat but there may be a line. | I’ve had luck booking same day at Osteria 57, the food is outstanding for vegetarians and fish lovers. No meat on the menu. Neighborhood feeling to the place and the service is FAST. | I like Lupa which is about a 5-7 minute walk from the Cellar and is usually easy to grab a last minute reservation. It’s across the street from Carbone.

I’m a madman and have done a 6:30pm Saturday show at Village Underground, 8pm reservation at Lupa, 9:30 pm show at the Cellar/VU back to back to back. | Cotenna | Olio y più is decent. Not amazing, but reliable and they have tables for 3 tonight. Quick walk to the Cellar.

Edit: Pastís also has availability. Further away but better, also extremely reliable. | Brunetti Pizza should have some availability - pizza is solid and its very easy to do a walk in for dinner | Restoration hardware rooftop | da toscano is really good italian food and only a couple mins away from comedy cellar. | the restaurant above comedy cellar called olive tree cafe

loring place | Figaro might have spots | Deninos | Definitely NOT PICCOLO ANGELO. Sub par food. Not a good atmosphere. Small , very bright , and tables are on top of each other . I would avoid this . | Correct | Cauldron Chicken is sooo good. That chicken is so flavorful and tender. | Oliu pilu is absolutely terrible | da toscano is very good, but iirc they require reservations and they have almost no availability | Actually the worst spot in Manhattan | I mean, it’s not great, but calling it absolutely terrible is a stretch | I mean idk what to tell you, in a neighborhood that’s likely the most densely populated for Italian restaurants, one that I live in. It’s the running joke amongst locals. I admit the location is great but idk anyone who would be caught dead eating there. It’s a tourist scam spot | Why is it rated so high? And where should one make a reservation for on a Sunday instead? | il totano is one I’m interested in trying next, new space, great chef. Res shouldn’t be tough | Also where is it highly rated? If you’re using Google review that’s a highly unserious metric | I am (it is usually reliable where I am from). Usually places at 4.6 or higher have great food.

Dropped the ball: Looking for places to pre-order a Thanksgiving dessert,"Every year, I like to treat myself with a special Thanksgiving dessert, and I choose a different place each year.

-	Lady Wong - Pandan Matcha Pie. It’s a pie but sounds really good. | Comfortland!!! Their Cannoli Rainbow Crumb Cake is divine (though quite sweet!!) and I think their Thanksgiving catering form also has pumpkin butterscotch pudding and ice cream pies :) | Carvel has ice cream turkeys.

is it shellfish only? all types of seafood? how many courses is too many? 

they’ve made up only a fraction of most tasting menus i’ve done and i imagine they’d easily sub a different protein or vegetable course(s) at all or nearly all of these spots if that’s something you’re open to."

Luxurious restaurant with great views?,"I have been tasked at work with finding a restaurant, preferably in midtown, that will accommodate about 15 people with great views. These are very important clients we are trying to impress. Any help would be appreciated!! ","While not in midtown, I was impressed with Manhatta.  Great food, bar, wine list and the amazing view.  And big enough to accommodate 15 people. | The Grill | The Modern! You get a view of the MoMA garden | Ci Siamo | the River Cafe | Midtown with views (assuming you mean from a high vantage point) is tough. There aren't really any fancy restaurants with rooftop-type views in Midtown, although there are a lot of rooftop bars with food if that is in line with what you're looking for.

SAGA and Manhatta in the Financial District are definitely the ""big two"" for luxurious restaurants with dramatic views. Only about 20-30 minutes by subway from Midtown. I think Manhatta is more realistic for a 15-person reservation; SAGA is quite small. | SAGA / PEAK | Robert on Columbus Circle. | If cost doesn’t matter check out the Edge restaurant | Working with midtown, skyline views, and good food: Gaonnuri | Manhatta. Saga/overstory. Estiatorio Milos. the River Cafe. The Fulton.  Peak at The Edge. (There are no restaurants in midtown with views. What would the view be of? Maybe Gaonnuri or Nubeluz or Robert). Btw these are all $$$-$$$$. But with important clients I assume that is ok. 

15 is a big group. They may ask you to use private dining which is a different price and menu.  Especially during the holidays where reservations are tight. | FYI Gaonnuri is temporarily closed. They're scheduled to reopen on Dec 1."

- Olle | What type of cuisine and what type of ambiance?Astoria has excellent Greek - Taverna Kyclades (among others). You can also get similar Greek for a bit more pricey at Avra in midtown. | Patok by Rach and Serrano Salsa for Inwood. | Greek restaurant in Astoria across from park - Agnanti. | Il Bambino (panini/crostini, good soups), Sarajevo Grill (Balkan meats), Cafe Triskell (French/Breton), Boishakhi (Bangladeshi), Bahari (Greek seafood), Aliada (Greek/Cypriot), Levant (Middle Eastern), Cronin & Phelan's (Irish pub food), Vite (Italian), Pye Boat Noodle (Vietnamese) in Astoria. | Seconded! Just limited seating | Every bit the equal of Hamido without the crazy wait | Came here to day king of falafel. When you’re at the counter, look confused while ordering, they’ll just hand you falafel to sample. | We eat a lot of Korean, Japanese, new American, & Vietnamese. We’re both pretty burnt out on Italian. 

Hyderabadi Zaiqa was one of the places we were considering, maybe I’ll go with that! Thanks! | Literally any type of cuisine, and for vibe? Somewhere less than $75/person where they won’t mind us chatting our heads off. | Sadly Patok doesn’t open until 2 on Mondays, we’ve been trying to get there for months! | Haha nice strategy. Their falafel is so good. They’ve also given me a free one while waiting for my order. Really nice workers there. | Great, enjoy! | You won’t regret Taverna Kyclades | The food at Aliada is SO GOOD and they will literally forget about you, so you can feel free to sit there for hours unbothered. | 2 is lunchtime for me 😂😂 | Just go!"
Wo Hop alternatives ?,"Looking for something similar to wo hop, but where I can walk in at lunch and not have to worry about a wait. ","Hop Kee is right next door and has similar vibes: Chinese-American food in an overlit basement. 

Plus it's Bourdain-approved: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_uXXkPhmhuU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uXXkPhmhuU) | Noodle town | [Hop Lee Restaurant](https://youtu.be/1k95TCYWrQk) is right across the street! Really cheap lunch specials! | I like Nyonya.  Great lunch specials but cash only.  Malaysian/Chinese food. | Wo hop is so mid. Deluxe green Bo, uncle lue, green garden just to name a few | Uncle Lou | Sun Sai Gai | Try some more popular places to locals,not tourists! I recommend Wu’s Wonton King | Supreme is great honestly. 100 mott st | Hop Lee is our favorite. Was also featured on NYT top 100 restaurants last year, but fell off this year. Same vibe, but with food that is actually good | Cafe Hong Kong has a very good lunch deal and the food never misses. | Don’t they have a basement annex which is basically the same thing? | deluxe green bo is my favorite in that area but there can also be a wait occasionally | FYI: Deluxe Green Bo is “Temporarily Closed” right now. | Yeah Shanghai Deluxe, Uncle Lou's, HK Wonton Garden (My absolute favorite), Shanghai 21 | Cafe Hong Kong on bayard | Hop Kee pretty much next door- hands down. Went to Hop Kee the other night walked right in and was astonished at the line for Wo Hop! | Nom Wah Tea Parlor, on the Crooked Street, has upgraded the decor, but still excellent for dim sum and such | Anyhting Bourdain-approved has to be great, what a guy! | Thank you for being brave enough to say it. I've been a few times, and I never got the hype behind it. | DELUXE GREEN BAO! | Deluxe Green Bo is kinda trash these days imo :( It used to be so good but now it’s overly salty and greasy. Love Uncle Lou though | Are you talking about downstairs wohop or upstairs next door wohop? Upstairs wohop has very solid cantonese food and some items here I find they make better than Uncle Lous. | Wo Glop amirite | Word. So hype but doesn’t seem anything amazing. | As a local, Wo Hop has a lot of nostalgia and memories to me. Going there as a kid with my father, late nights when it used to be 24/7 after the bars with friends, date nights. It’s a tourist stop on the map thanks to guides, tik tak and instagram. But it was always locals first. | Hahaha wohop is 100% a locals first spot.  No longer being 24/7 kinda kills the best part of it though. | Other way around. The basement one is the original, the street level one is newer. They have slight differences in the menu and how food's prepared. 99% of this sub much prefers the downstairs one. I personally found the street level (Wo Hop Next Door) to be much better. Maybe its just who was running the kitchen on the times I went. | Wo Hop was legendary when it was opened 24/7. 

The bars are closing, they're kicking you out, the group you were drinking with are splitting for the night. You gather the remaining people to make a special trip to Wo Hop at 3 am in the morning.

People usually go for the American Chinese food but I usually go for the Hong Kong style crispy noodles.

Now that they close early, it's 100% not worth the trip. You can get better authentic Chinese food elsewhere and I don't feel like their American Chinese food is significantly much better than your local corner Chinese takeout spot. | Fellow native, it’s also a childhood nostalgia place for me. My mom and her siblings went there long before I was born. | I've tried most of the American Chinese food places people mention, and the ""local corner spots"", and none hit it as well as Wo Hop for me. When I lived out of state, any random corner spot did it, but in NYC they try to be some weird hybrid of Americanized Chinese food and authentic stuff, so it just doesn't do it. 

I'll continue trying every spot I can just out of curiosity (there's a lot of em!), but I feel like Wo Hop is definitely not overrated if one wants that takeout style done well. All the other ones just make me feel like I should have gone and had real Chinese food instead (but that wasn't what I wanted!)"
Elbow Bread,"Since this new spot has been anointed as one of the next buzzy bakeries, and since I do like Zoë Kanan and Court Street Grocers, I decided to check it out on a weekday afternoon. What I got:

Honey challah braid: First bite was good, but too one-note and cloyingly sweet every bite after that. Would skip unless you love sweet. 

Roll with butter (forgot the specific name): Actually pretty good, but this mostly comes down to the nice slab of butter sandwiched in the middle. Bread was fine. Wouldn’t object to getting this again, but you could easily recreate yourself tbh. 

Salted sweet potato pretzel (served with side of mustard): A fine pretzel, baked and formed well, but couldn’t really tell what the sweet potato added. Essentially tasted like a regular pretzel, and not even as good as some others in the city. (Librae does great ones with toppings.) Would skip. Maybe the cinnamon sugar one is better?

Overall cost about $21 for three items. 

Ultimately, wouldn’t go out of my way to try again. ","I don’t know what changed, but she started the summer testing out a bunch of things that looked amazing, announced an August opening. Then whatever happened happened and the menu looks completely different and opened 2 months late


It’s like they decided the best ROI is going all in on low cost pretzels | Thanks for the review! I miss Mel (was in this space previously) so much 😞😞😞 | I appreciate the honest and straightforward review. You save the rest of us valuable time | We walked by there the other day and there was a long line. Went to local stalwart Michaeli’s around the corner and had great pastries as always. | I also got lost in the social media hype and felt it was trash. Disliked immensely and the service was incredibly slow. | Yeah, this place was forgettable at best. I’d much rather hit Librae or even La Cabra. It didn’t do it for me at all. | I did not feel worth it. Rugelach had solid enough flavor but was so dry, the pretzel is very simply a pretzel (good mustard), and the knish was good, but nothing was great. Maybe the challah honey bun could be different, but I am not compelled to go back or wait in a line to have it again.
Edited to add: you’re spot on about the pretzel. Disappointed to not find anything sweet potato about it. | Thank you! I don’t want sweet bread that doesn’t need to be sweet. | I tried it a few weeks ago and was equally disappointed. | Walk north and go to le fournil | Adding link to their IG, by request of this subreddit, otherwise this post will be deleted: https://www.instagram.com/elbowludlow?igsh=MW1tZjc3djhxMzM4eA== | Had to try for myself although I hadn’t gotten them fed in my algo previously. Only tried the knish (was also tempted by the smaltz scallion) but def didn’t seem anything special, and certainly not $7 special. Miss Mel’s for sure! | Oh huh, very interesting! That's such a shame. | Mel is unbelievable | I echo this! You saved me $21 | Haha my pleasure! | I love Michaeli! They do a tasty cherry pistachio croissant."

Best Curry Crab in nyc?,"Looking for Singapore/Malaysian curry crab. All good if it’s in Queens, Brooklyn, or Manhattan

Places to take my grandparents in Chinatown?,"Preferably one place, or two places within walking distance of each other. They're 88 and 94 years old, and not incredibly mobile. We'll be taking a taxi there.

They are conservative and like ""simple and nice."" So a place like Fu Zhou Wei is probably not on the schedule.

I've made a list of amazing places in the area, but they're all hella cheap and kinda grungy (my vibe.) Is there a crazy nice but not too expensive place in the area you'd recommend that's more accessible to older folks, and maybe a little more polished? Obviously bang-to-buck matters, but it's not everything.

Feel free to recommend more than one. Looking for any guidance.

456 New Shanghai

Golden Shanghai

Hwa Yuan Szechuan (fancy)

Peking Duck House (fancy)

Ping's | Hwa Yuan | Jing fong in centre street, Peking duck house - you can make a reservation to both | Uncle Wu’s | Just remember that most nicer Chinese places serve family style, so a dish may seem expensive but actually feed four people. 

That in mind: 

Hwa Yuan. It’s a little more expensive but it’s very nice and you can make reservations. Ask to be on the first floor, though.

Slightly less expensive: Wu’s (best Wonton soup in town), Uncle Lou’s (nicer ambience than Wu’s, good food), Royal Seafood (ditto), Golden Unicorn (nice ambience, forgettable food) | Take them for tea at silk road café and then go to Wo Hop. | Uncle Lou | Are they of Chinese descent/origin? What do they usually eat? | I think you should take them to dim sum (House of Joy on Pell St.) on a weekday afternoon. It could be a cool experience and since dim sum is small dishes they can sample many different items. Afterwards, while having your grandparents wait in the dim sum restaurant, you could run to Hay Hay Roasted to buy some roast meats (roast duck and soy sauce chicken are my favorites) to take home for dinner with your grandparents. Oh and pop into Fay Da bakery next door to pick up egg tarts and pastries for them to try at home. | My top choice would be Dim Sum Palace on Division Street. It’s a bit pricier but the food there is really good and it doesn’t feel like you’re being ripped off. My friends and I went there for dim sum a couple of months ago and not only is the dim sum great, all the dishes we ordered off of the regular menu were excellent. The table next to us ordered the crab from the tank and it smelled so good. As a bonus, the decor and service is much nicer than most Chinatown establishments. When we went on Sunday morning, it was packed to the gills with Chinese uncles and aunties and I take that as a sign as the food is being well-received by the Chinese community. 

Another good choice would be New Yue Wong restaurant on Bayard Street. It’s a different vibe than Dim Sum Palace but I think it’s pretty nice by Chinatown standards when it comes to service and decor. They specialize in Cantonese roast meats and I can attest they’re quite good but their menu has a good variety of dishes to suit everyone. 

Both recs I have are for Cantonese places and since you didn’t specify which regional cuisine, I think Cantonese would be a great option. It’s a crowd pleaser. | These are all near each other:

Big wong

Ming Wong

Kong Sikh Tong

Bo ky


peking duck house

ping's | Pings | Yeah Shanghai Deluxe at 50 Mott St, New York, NY 10013  (The name keeps changing but the location stays the same.) | I just want to recommend going during the weekday if possible.  Weekends get crowded with tourists and I am just concerned about your grandparents getting jostled.  Try to stay off Canal in particular. | Ok let’s be real here. The best places for them are:

Hwa Yuan (has wine and full bar)
House of Joy

All these places have a bathroom on the ground floor or one accessible by elevator. I’m not 100% on Dim Sum Palace, but they should have one on the ground floor too. I also like Golden Unicorn, but their bathrooms get funky fast and it’s not great for older, conservative folk who aren’t used to that lack of service. | Hwa Yuan! | What type of food exactly are you looking for?

In search of the most delicious doner kebab in nyc pls ,Hi! I’m visiting from Chicago. It’s only my second time in NYC. I went to Berlin a few years ago and had the most insane doner kebab I’ve ever had in my life. When I googled it I found out it was rated #2 doner kebab shop in the world. I’ve been on the hunt for a doner kebab this good since. Nothing in chicago comes close. Hoping you lovely people can please point me in the direction. Pic for proof!!,"tacis beyti

Since it was a Turkish doner spot in Berlin I am imagining German? | Generally, German kebab is enjoyed with scharf (spicy), kräuter (herb), and knoblauch (garlic) sauces. A rule of thumb is two out of the three, but not all three.

The Chicken Gemüse Döner Kebab, also came later. Historically, in Germany it was always beef, until Mad Cow hit in the 90's, then the modern Chicken German kebab came to existence, also adapted to German tastes. Chicken Döner meat, salad, tomatoes, onions, sauce, fried vegetables (potatoes, peppers, onions, etc.), and on top, crumbled Turkish white cheese and a squeeze of lemon. | Seconding Turco, total hidden gem in the city | Prices have skyrocketed, but the lamb gyro is still worth it.

doner kebab is turkish

turks in berlin put it on bread and made it portable | Then they should type bratwurst or something, not döner kebab lol. You could at least write ""Turkish German"" food, would you really call general Tso's american food without any mention of Chinese heritage? | So it's a different food?

Pizza was invented in Italy but NYC pizza is American | They’re originally Turkish but if you had one in Berlin it’s a Berlin doner. Kinda like how nyc style pizza is a thing even tho it’s from Italy. | You've started a war sir (assuming), now you have to take responsibility!

Lol, welcome to reddit. | I put up the link not you discussed semantics but to say this is amazing food here including the vegetarian appetizer tray. It’s really delicious food. | Yeah! That’s the version I had I am assuming with the Turkish white cheese. Phenomenal | It’s a literal hole in the wall, the width of the store is 10-12 feet max | The bread is out of this world.

I know what I’m getting today | uh thanks 😁❤️ | At least I can be assured you aren't a paid shill cause honestly their branding is kind of a strange choice for a restaurant. | honestly, i've never even bothered because of the pornhub branding. ironically, a big turnoff. | Ankara in LES is kickass, I’ve never had the doner but everything else I’ve had is amazing. It’s just not “cheap” but it’s fresh and quality. | You got donered lol | those are just German words for things that exist on most doner kebabs, no? Pita, yogurt sauce, spicy sauce, etc. I stand by my initial statement | Yes | Doner kebab is not German food | It’s got a superlative reputation? Looks unimpressive from the google listing!

 https://g.co/kgs/nb82cB4 | It's Turkish in origin, but just like Chinese takeout is Chinese in origin, but heavily modified and adapted to American tastes, German Doner is heavily modified and adapted to German tastes. | Correct! The spots I went to in Berlin was a Turkish diner kebab place :) | This is like a completely incorrect understanding of what doner kebab lol. | Take a trip to Germany, have a doner kebab, and say wtf is this, this ain't turkish food.

Enjoy the scharf.

I personally can't stand the original Turkish variety and prefer the bastardized German variety heavily sauced with German sauces. | pizza is italian. 

has it changed here? sure. doesn't mean its not italian. maybe italian-american if you wanna be as pedantic as the other guy. 

pedantry is tiresome, though.  


one of my favorite kebabs is in copenhagen, i guess that must be danish food. | Haha thank you I am a 28 (f) (is that how you phrase it?) lol I rarely post but thank you for the comments they have been so entertaining. I am aiming to try one of these spots today to see if they can fill the void but I doubt it | I got donerrhea | If you think Pita is the same as Pide, do you also think all bread is the same regardless of type? I should really call it Fladenbrot, Pide is the Turkish original bread, while Fladenbrot is the current form of flatbread used in Germany.

Tzatziki and Halal cart white sauce, both yogurt based, the same as well?

Sriracha and Tabasco, both spicy sauce, the same too?

It’s these differences that differentiate one cuisine from another. | Chinese takeout is American food.

Now read the OP's post again about which Doner he liked, and what cuisine it's from. | I understand where you’re coming from | You're more right about the German Doner but Chinese takeout is not Chinese in origin at all, maybe one or two dishes.  90% of the dishes you see on Chinese menus, especially in NYC, or other states has been Westernized/Americanized for sure! | Berlin has a huge Turkish population, something like 120,000 Turks, I'd imagine you can get some authentic doners there. | [deleted] | [https://berlinexperiences.com/was-the-doner-kebab-invented-in-berlin-mythbusting-berlin/](https://berlinexperiences.com/was-the-doner-kebab-invented-in-berlin-mythbusting-berlin/) | yeaaaaaaahhhh

been there many times-the berlin version is on worse bread and not as good as what i get here. 

what you are doing is like calling pizza american food because it was popularized as quick hand food in nyc. | NYC pizza is American. Italian Pizza id Italian.

If that Danish kebab has morphed into a unique Danish way then it's a Danish kebab. 

For example in the Netherlands they have a have a kebab dish which is kebab meat, fries salad, Gouda, garlic sauce and sambal. It's a dutch food not a Turkish food. | Obviously not, do you think every place in Berlin uses the same sauce, same bread? Each one should be different. That’s how you can compare which places are good and which are bad. 

Doner kebab in Berlin is Turkish, Efes in New Brunswick is also Turkish. | Let‘s turn it around: Hamburgers are not American, but German. | I like scharf and knoblauch with my beef kebab and scharf and kräuter with my gemüse kebab.

  
If you told a Turkish person that, they'd be looking at you like you were from another planet. | Beef w/ Broccoli has Chinese origins.  
General Tso’s Chicken has Taiwanese origins.  
Dumplings, egg rolls, chow mein, chop suey, egg foo young, etc.

Plenty of stuff on a Chinese takeout menu have their original form in Chinese cuisine.

Plenty of stuff, however, that is completely American. (Half fried chicken w/ pork fried rice) | I’m surprised posters on a food forum don’t seem to understand any of this. 

Doner Kebab, as we in the west know it, is a unique combination of palettes from Turkish and German tastes. 

This is like saying that “Mexico probably has pretty good Spanish Tacos”. 

Like, no… the tacos that we love are Mexica/aztec/indigenous flavors/preparations with Spanish influences and preparations. Spain doesn’t have tacos - Mexico does. 

Doner Kebab in the west is a uniquely geographically German cuisine, and it was invented by Turkish Germans.

Source: doner is my favorite food ever and I’ve spent extended time in Turkey as well as all of the former Ottoman Empire (Balkans etc.) as well as extensive time in Germany. 

The true “authentic” Turkish doner is not the same as “doner kebab”. 

OP is looking for doner kebab. It’s called Berlin-style döner kebap | You would think so, but NYC has a healthy Chinese population, some of which open Chinese takeout places, but a Chinese person wouldn’t consider that Chinese food.

It’s not the population of the original culture at work, it’s the assimilation of that culture into the new country and adapting to the large market at hand over a long period of time that causes this cuisine to deviate from how it originally was. | Tbh having had a bunch in Berlin and Istanbul the German ones are better | No one said it's a pure German creation, just that it's been adapted so long in the German culture for German tastes that it's no longer Turkish in anything except origin.

The taste profile is completely different than a Turkish doner. | NYC pizza is most definitely American food.

Do you think they make pizza like that in Italy? | It's funny when your post gets deleted because it has nothing to offer except for personal insults. | Amazing how you’ve proven yourself wrong so many times while being incredibly rude 😆 | There's a huge difference between different types of a sauce (your example) and different sauces from different cuisines with a common base (my example)

No one is debating that Doner kebab's origin in Germany is Turkish, but it's been there so long that it's no longer Turkish cuisine, since it's been customized and adapted to the German palate over the years.

You'll probably tell me next that Chinese takeout is actually Chinese food rather than American food, in which case, you'll have both the Chinese and the Americans disagreeing with you.

Efes in New Brunswick is what Turkish people want to eat. Doner kebab in Berlin is what German people want to eat. Germans and Turks do not share the same flavor profile.

  
It's really not hard to understand that food changes from its original form over decades of localization when it becomes part of the local fabric and culture. | Yeah it was gemüse kebab that I had in Berlin. Stuff of dreams- I guess I’ll only ever find that in Germany then | Beef w/ Broccoli has Chinese origins because Chinese immigrants created it in America (San Francisco) for American palates.  Broccoli wasn't even around in China at all so yes Chinese origins by way of Chinese immigrants already in America but not from China or created in China at all.  General Tso's was again by an immigrant and the sauce started in Taiwan essentially but changed and made sweeter for American consumers.  You're half right but not as much as you think you are and not even trying to be negative just informing.  Most of the stuff is completely American you'd be surprised.  Visit China or Taiwan and ask for half the stuff available in the US and they would laugh at your or tell you they've never heard of it. | People would rather live in a world of ignorance and believe than German döner is still Turkish food, Chinese takeout is still Chinese food and NY-style pizza is still Italian food, than believe the phenomenon in front of their eyes of food culture assimilation and localization creating a derivative product that no longer matches the palette of the original food item. | Like chicken parm, it’s American. Created in New Jersey by Italian immigrants, modifying eggplant recipes. | As it turns out I am! Thank you. | This has always interested me. Some Chinese food places have like 200 dishes and there’s only like 25 that are commonly ordered by Americans. Always makes me wonder who is ordering the other 175 dishes and if those 175 are more authentic | If you want good tacos you gotta go to Taco Bell, you know because there are Latin folks here. | Are you talking about first and second generation Chinese living in Chinese areas of the city? Because that's what you'll see with the Turkish population in in Berlin. Not talking about food adapted for. a different palate, just fast food like you'd get in Istanbul. | [deleted] | Funny that he brought up the pizza comparison, when it’s the perfect example to prove your point 😂 | [removed] | ok | You’ll find a chicken kebab in Turkey, but it won’t be of the same style as the Berliner gëmuse kebab. | You're literally saying Chinese cooks in America are modifying native Chinese / Taiwanese dishes for the American palate.

That's literally the definition of Chinese origin, localized to the American market, which is identically analogous to Turkish origin, localized to the German market cuisine of German Doner. | Germán doner is German-Turkish. 

Food assimilation, as you say, is ASSIMILATION. Edit: you are CORRECT. SORRY for YELLING. 

German Doner Kebap is a German invention by Turkish-Germans. 

Turkish cuisine restaurants may offer Berlin-style doner, but it’s not only Turkish. Purely Turkish doner is different. | All the menus are standard across most Chinese American restaurants, if you look closely you’ll realize most dishes are the same few ingredients recycled. | But don’t go to Taco King, cuz that’s all Chinese folk!

God I love NYC. Chinese run taco joints hit different. | I'm talking about the first and second generation Chinese living in Chinese areas of the city but opening / working establishments that serve the cuisine adapted to their new country's tastes.

So for example, in Flushing:

the owners and workers of New Kissena

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/T8LobhGY8FgWeTm68](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T8LobhGY8FgWeTm68)

rather than the owners and workers of Szechuan Mountain House Flushing

[https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZhA9e2bzD3VjQpY9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZhA9e2bzD3VjQpY9)

The first is localized cuisine, primarily owned and operated by Chinese immigrants, similar to the majority of German doner shops you'll find in Berlin, which are primarily run by people of Turkish descent. The second is authentic / traditional cuisinse, similar to Mardin (https://maps.app.goo.gl/ecZ3yeynFpzVxkmJA) where they're still trying to maintain the original taste of the cuisine as best they can. | You're absoultely right and the Turkish version in Turkey will always be better and NOT in Istanbul.  Was invented in Bursa and that's where you should have it... | Have a nice day. | You're missing my point in its entirety.  While you're not wrong they weren't plates readily availalbe in China, etc.  The only thing would be the sauces or meat besides that not ""Chinese"" at all just adopted and modified. | I’m agreeing with you sir.

I’m not the one insisting that German doner is purely Turkish, I’m the one saying it has Turkish origins and has been adapted to the German market, so is now a staple of German food cuisine and is quite different than the original Turkish kebab found in Turkey. | Not my jam personally, I’d prefer a Mexican run “Tex-mex” place but my partner loves them. | How is that different than German Doner brought back to Turkey for consumption by native Turks or NY-style pizza brought back to Italy for consumption by native Italians? | Oh ok cool my bad big dawg

You and I are both right and everyone else needs to fly to Berlin asap and try the real deal

Where can I find the best banh mi and which banh mi is the one you typically order?,"I was quite a fan of banhmigos for a while but outside of that not really experienced with banh mi and im sure there are some much better ones. Some places im looking at include Thanh Da and Ba Xuyen. Wondering which one locals in the area generally prefer flavorwise. Then theres Cơm Tấm Ninh Kiều in the Bronx. Banh mi Saigon, Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli, Saiguette are some in Manhattan. But what place truly has the best banh mi the city has to offer? And which from them is your favorite to order?","I was pleasantly surprised by the banh mui cart in fidi. | Saiguette | Thanh Da is good, but Ba Xuyen is next level. Definitely the best I’ve had in town. 

Both of the Saigons in Manhattan are solid. The one on Grand St is better than the one on Broome. 

I actually also like Bahnmigos. Their bbq pork is good. There’s another small chain that I like called Two Wheels that’s kinda similar to Banhmigos. It’s a little more bougie, but I think it’s also a little better food. 

And there’s a place in Brooklyn Heights called Diem that I never hear anyone talk about. Not sure why it’s so under the radar, but it might be one of the best.  | Banh Mi Co Ut is still my favorite in the city. I get the 'dac biet' or special, which is the typical Vietnamese cold cuts. | i really like Henry's in Park Slope | My go-to order is usually the #1 / classic / roast pork / dac biet ""special.""

The absolute ""best"" will depend on personal preferences. I usually rotate between these places, depending on what I'm craving and if I'm nearby:

-	Banh Mi Co Ut
-	Banh Mi Saigon
-	Saigon Vietnamese
-	Saiguette
-	Ba Xuyen
-	JoJu
-	Banh | Ba Xuyen > Thanh Da by a wide margin. | JoJu in Elmhurst has banh mi that really hits the spot for me. | My go-to spot is Saigon Bakery on Grand St in Manhattan. I always order a #1 spicy which is their BBQ pork sandwich. | Cơm Tấm Ninh Kiều in the Bronx has a brisket and bone marrow banh mi that is out of this world. | I recently tried Diem in Brooklyn Heights, and it was actually up there with the ones previously mentioned in Sunset Park. | Bahn in upper west 106th st and same owners as com tam Minh kieu.  My viet wife loves the banh mi and snail dish they serve.  Check it out! | Xe May in east village | As noted by others: Ba Xuen and Banh Mi Co Ut.

I'd also highly recommend a local spot by me which is outstanding; Diem Cafe.

At both, I like the classic | I didn't like Banh Mi Sai Gon's traditional banh mi as much as other places, but their most popular is good if you like BBQ. I lived near Ba Xuyen so I'm most familiar with them. My favorite so far, and I get them when I'm in the area, which is rarely.

Go to Ba Xuyen. Bring cash. | My vote is Two Wheels on the UWS. Delicious! | Two Wheels UES and UWS | Would also like to know. Am from Minneapolis where we have a lot of really good Vietnamese, but when it comes to banh mi here nobody has the right bread. | If you’re on the UWS:
Banh’s roasted pork banh mi 

Saiguette’s grilled lemongrass pork banh mi

Both are delicious, and are different from each. Saiguette is on a bigger, softer baguette. They go a little harder on the mayo too in my experience | joju is rock solid | Idk if it’s the best but I got the fish Bahn Mi at 5 Spice and I got the fried runny egg added and it was pretty delish | I have enjoyed Banh Mi Zon. Both the traditional pork ones and the chicken ones are great 

For what it’s worth I disliked Banh because the bread was like a French baguette and not ideal airy ones | I'm from Central Florida (and vietnamese!) and tbh, no banh mi in NYC has come even close to any little sandwich shop in Little Saigon in Orlando. That being said, I'm partial to Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli. House special is usually the go-to but I also like the grilled minced pork! Surpringly, Tea & Milk also has pretty good banh mi (bbq pork!!!) | Two Wheels in UES! | Pho 39 is good near Bryant park, especially for  lunch. | I didn't like Banh Mi Sai Gon's traditional banh mi as much as other places, but their most popular is good if you like BBQ. I lived near Ba Xuyen so I'm most familiar with them. My favorite so far, and I get them when I'm in the area, which is rarely.

Go to Ba Xuyen. Bring cash. | I liked Bricolage around cobble hill/park slope. Its a cool spot and I really enjoyed their Bahn mi! | I’m not too well versed on banh mi to be completely honest, and I haven’t actually tried a lot of the recommended places here, but I am partial to Banh Mi Zon in east village as it’s close.

For me, the bread is a critical component. I’ve suffered stale baguettes a lot, where the act of taking a bite requires unhinging your jaw and then gnashing your teeth. The bread here has crunch and is fluffy on the inside, giving it a great squeeze and bite. | For me it goes:

Saigon Vietnamese sandwich deli - not traditional but their chicken banh mi is so good. I eat it once a week. #5 with Pate is also great. 

Banh mi co ut - this one is the best tasting but they’re so stingy with the toppings and sauce. I ask for spicy and it’s not spicy at all.

Banh mi Saigon - good but very inconsistent. Many times the bread is stale and hard. When it’s fresh it’s very good but it’s a gamble. I like that they take card and are a little less expensive than the other two.

After seeing these comments I gotta try Ba Xuyen asap. | Vietnaam pork belly banh mi | I like Joju’s “sweet Joju” banh mi. I can’t remember what I had at Ba Xuyen but remember liking it a lot. Fuck it I will try any banh mi recommended here. I also like Banhmigos | I’m personally not a fan of Banh Mi Co Ut … everytime I’ve gone either the bread is way too hard or the sandwich itself is pretty bland. The hard bread surprised me because the baguette they give at their sister restaurant Kitchen Co Ut is so good.

I used to go to Sau Voi for the cold cuts, it was the closest thing I’ve found to saigon and it was good but they closed down and its been a struggle to find a comparable one since. 

I went to the Saigon on Broome when I was growing up but quality and all it doesnt hit the same so nowadays I go to Banh Mi Saigon - its good and convenient. Sometimes I order delivery from V-Nam Cafe, they have pretty good banh mi as well. Also have had Joju which is mentioned and can +1 that they also have a tasty banh mi.

Definitely heard good things about Ba Xuyen but too lazy to commute to brooklyn. | Ba Xuyen, i frequently take a detour to get some. Worth it!! | Cơm Tấm Ninh Kiều in the Bronx for me. Been going there for years and re-tried their banh mi this week bc I forgot hot good it is. I get the lemongrass chicken with hella hoisin and sriracha. Perfect crusty bread, not too hard to where it doesn't cut the roof of your mouth. Surprisingly bigger than I remember. And for $11 it's not terrible for NY (where I'm from I get them for $4.50 so I'm spoiled) | Saigon Vietnamese Deli used to be my spot. Haven’t lived in NY for awhile but the special there was always delicious back in the day. Anyone know if it’s still good? | Banh mi Place on Washington in Prospect Heights was my go to when I lived in the neighborhood, seriously miss living around the corner from there.

Recently learned the owner’s sister runs/owns Lotus in Park Slope, which I’m tempted to try tomorrow for lunch! | Ba Xuyen is my favorite. | Ba Xuyen has been my favorite for years. Always a great sandwich. | Nha Mình in ridgewood!!!!!! | Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli. Get the #1. That’s is all. | Saigon Vietnamese Sandwich Deli in Nolita is the go-to | Banh mi zon is great | Henry’s | Boi licious is a hole in wall near grand central, hits the spot.i grab the bbq pork one but there's others | banh mi Saigon is great, and Hanco in park slope has been my go to since moving to Brooklyn. | ba xuyen is better than banh mi saigon. banh mi saigon is very sweet while ba xuyen has a lot of black pepper notes. Banh mi co ut in chinatown is good as well. | Ba xuyen | There used to be a place east of GCT that had a crispy duck bahn mi that was outstanding.  Not sure if it's still there. | I haven’t tried that many places but Two Wheels was so incredibly flavorful, and the daikon was so good | Moneycat is worth a try if you are near Bushwick/Ridgewood. Their bahn mi is not too large, but the bread is surprisingly spot on: crunches well/brittle outside and soft inside, stands up nicely to the mayo + condiments. Not like a soft squishy ""mini baguette"" that lots of places use.The bread reminds me of bahn mi I ate growing up in the Bay Area. The Downside is they dont do a traditional version with the pate + cold cuts + pork. 

The pork is great, the chinese sausage is interesting and the tofu one is very clean and lets the ingredients shine. I think they had a brisket option, but I could be wrong. | anyone have recs on a mushroom bahn mi? Dhom used to have one that was incredible but sadly they closed down | Hanover Square or Water/Pine? I've been to the latter one and liked it. | I used to work near there. Their vermicelli bowls are good too. | I dream about juicy boneless chicken thigh | Definitely Ba Xuyen! I used to live close by and it was always super great. | Ba Xuyen is the best in the city. And totally agree about Diem - I even love its tofu banh mi when I’m feeling less gluttonous. | I think Bahnmigos gave me food poisoning.  Will have to try Diem. | if you’re talking about banh mi saigon, that’s not true banh mi. sweetened for the american palate. 

saigon vietnamese banh mi and kitchen co ut - extra pate | I'd also like to say..I avoid any shop that serves ground up five spice pork or lemongrass chicken as toppings. Also places that just do carrot pickles and no daikon. | \+1 Bahn Mi Co Ut

Went when they first opened during Covid, but haven't been in a while.

I'll also add, at least in my experience, viet restaurants that happen to have Bahn Mi never live up to the best Bahn Mi shops that specialize only in Bahn Mi. | Excellent, predictable, and somehow they're ringing your doorbell before the receipt page is done loading. | Henry’s is outstanding | Same company as Henry's on Fulton in Manhattan? | Their fries are the best thing on the menu. 2x fried with the daikon slaw. | Which one of their banh mis do you recommend? | It’s a weekly trip from woodside for me. I like the sweet Joju the best! | There’s a JoJu in Tangram Mall in Flushing | yeah I've noticed that too (I'm from CA). The right bread, I think, has a percentage of rice flour in it. Which must not be a thing here. | Grew up in Houston and  have p much given up on viet food around here after a lot of disappointing meals, like might as well save the cravings for trips out of town | As a New Orleanian also used to better banh mi (and particular about the texture of banh mi baguettes) , if you haven‘t tried it already, my fave spot is Banh Mi Place in Prospect Heights if you‘re ever over that way. The family that owns it is so sweet. 💗 | Is it wrong that I love Viet Nomz down there too | Yo.. I'm a bay area vietnamese and live in the bush for 9 years now. Please don't hate me, but I think Moneycat is slightly below mediocre. I like fusion, but the food has to be good, the flavors are confused there. | Not mushroom but love the vegan bahn mi at Saigon Shack! | The one I went to was Hanover, I'll have to check out the Water/Pine one one day. | >that’s not true banh mi. sweetened for the american palate

I don't care if one is more ""true"" than the other. I'm going to go with the one that's more *delicious*. 

Also, stop gatekeeping banh mi. | This is unfortunately the norm for banh mi in NYC. Saiguette is awful, and I don’t understand why it keeps getting mentioned in this sub. | Why? Just curious. | I once gave them the wrong amount when getting delivery and then went to the restaurant to make it right. The delivery guy showed back up and yelled at me for underpaying. My boyfriend had to break it down to him because I was so embarrassed | I'm a simple man, I like me a classic banh mi with the ham and paté. If I want to get fancy, it's good with the runny egg. Bulgogi bomb me is another good one but 90% of the time, I'm ordering a classic. | viet food here, AT BEST is just okay. philly viet blows nyc out of the water. | I hear ya. I guess places in proper bier communities have bakeries specializing in the viet baguettes, but here they either use deli hero or more crusty French style baguettes. | Fair! I mostly like their bread. :) | hilarious that you think it’s gatekeeping when i’m simply pointing out it’s not authentic. anything can be delicious when made for someone with basic tastes. ppl like you are why a lot of the ethnic food that gets rec’d here is mid. as long as it’s loaded up with salt and sugar i guess 💀💀💀 | The five spice pork is a Chinese adaptation, and lemongrass chicken is generally a rice dish. What we get in NY is usually a soy braised chicken with some lemongrass vs a fish sauce forward chicken.

A carrot pickle only sandwich is sweet and lacks balance, you need the daikon. | >hilarious that you think it’s gatekeeping when i’m simply pointing out it’s not authentic.

This is literally the definition of gatekeeping. Who are you to decide if something is ""authentic"" or not?

Also, ""authentic"" doesn't always equal ""better."" I'd rather have an inauthentic banh mi that's executed well than an authentic one that's executed poorly. | Is Co Ut the only place in NY that does Vietnamese ham and pate? I've learned the hard way that most places don't have it. But instead go with ground pork/beef and mayonnaise. | To offer another perspective, sometimes I just want something that tastes like home. I grew up in a Vietnamese ghetto and we’d buy traditional banh mi for like $1.10 from our local bakeries almost every week as a kid. I love fusion but if I was in the mood for a classic banh mi, I’d be disappointed. 

I don’t think it’s gatekeeping for u/noahswetface to point out what style of banh mi to expect - though of course you are right that authentic doesn’t mean better (or have any bearing on quality). | it’s funny you’re claiming something is “executed well”when it’s obvious you don’t know OR care what it should actually taste like. taco bell must love you. | Nah lots of places do the pate. Banh Mi Saigon is a decent option if you're in the area. | > what it should actually taste like

Again with the gate-keeping language. | Let me clarify: You don’t understand what “banh mi” is. Just call what you like a extra sweet bbq minced pork sandwich. | Banh mi is the result of multicultural influences, so your argument that there is only one “banh mi” is ridiculous on its face. | I didn’t say there’s only one banh mi. There are few places here that do a decent/okay job. If you want to eat anything in a “hoagie”, be my guest. But don’t insult it by calling it banh mi. It’s just another sandwich. 

I can understand why people create “deconstructed banh mi salads” here. Y’all are the exact audience for it."
Angelina Paris Bryant Park,"I've been looking for a good omelette and someone on here said the food at this place was ""shockingly good"" but I have to say, it wasn't even that good.  And the service!  Does no one ever check to see if you want more of something, or anything else, any more?  (This happened at Miriam 76th st, too, not too long ago.)  I know, pick, pick, pick... 

I had the omelette Angelina, french fries and an americano.  I wouldn't go back for even one of those things at half price.  Now, it wasn't a truck stop omelette.  But it wasn't ... eh... carefully made.  I got the impression the chef had made a million of 'em and was kind of bored.

Am I nuts?  Should I have tried the croissants?  ","It’s kind of a tourist/Instagram trap. They’re specifically famous for their hot chocolate and pastries. 

I didn’t even realize they had hot food, but I’m not surprised it was mediocre.  | I think expecting a “shockingly good” omelette set the bar way too high and was never going to pay off. | I'm probably the person who said shockingly good (since I found it a surprise they even had food that wasn't pastry).

I've had, iirc, a croque madam, French onion soup and something risoto like (I don't remember) all of which were v/ good.  Similarly the service was honestly really good when I've went, attentive without being obsequious.

But it's been about a year since I went, so shit can change, or it can be an off day.

Scrolling through food photos on gmaps, wow, those omelets look really sad, ESPECIALLY for a French spot! I'm sorry. | I went there for a work meeting and my sandwich was just ok, I could probably make it at home and tastier. It is a pretty place and definitely that is the only reason you go there, besides that you could save your money and go somewhere else. | Yeah, they got me... | Oh, I can't say that's what I EXPECTED... but I sure was hoping for a little better than what I got.  Just something that looked like attention had been paid.  Ah well.  My mother makes two kinds of whiskey, etc... | lol I don't hold it against you, I promise.  I do kinda hold it against THEM... | I have to admit, it's a very nice place to sit and have coffee.  Apart from that:  what I said."

Groceries in Hell’s Kitchen/UWS,"What’s the best value for groceries around HK/UWS?  I’m by Columbus Circle and am curious if there are places (other than TJs) where I could do a quick in and out for groceries.  Would also love to know if people have tips like (and this is made up as an example): target has cheapest snacks, gristedes has best quality produce, hudson market for olive oil, morton williams for meat, etc.! 

Thanks!!","you're not getting better value than TJs | West Side Rag did a comparison of ten grocery stores for some twenty items. Results inside: [https://www.westsiderag.com/2023/05/30/frugal-frannie-finds-surprising-uws-grocery-inflation-data](https://www.westsiderag.com/2023/05/30/frugal-frannie-finds-surprising-uws-grocery-inflation-data) | > gristedes has best quality produce

hahaha | Target price match has saved me hundreds at this point probably lol that's all I can recommend. | I order from Aldi or Food Bazaar, and even given the fees and tips, it’s way cheaper than Gristedes where a block of Polly-o mozzarella is like $12. | Whole Foods or Amish Market for produce. Westerley is good too but more expensive. | Whole Foods for me. | Amish may not be the cheapest but they are the number 1 reason I don't move away.  | Amish Market on 50th and 9th is great. Awesome deli too. | Whole foods for produce, Morton for meats like pork and chicken, target for snacks and toiletries | Westerly! Has the highest quality health food | food emporium | Spoiler: Trader Joe's was cheaper by about 25% compared to than any other store. Do beware, the lines get long. The longest time I've waited is 15 minutes. Whole foods was second cheapest, then Key, the Brooklyn Fare. Pro tip, Brooklyn Fare has the lowest minimum for free delivery ($35) if within ten blocks of the store. | I’ve been doing my own personal version of this for Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, Target, and Wegmans. Live within 10min walking distance of all three. TJ’s wins overall, and Target comes second, but there are products that are cheaper at WFs. There also some products you just can’t find at all three. 

Thanks for linking this! | I order from Aldi and stock up on the days DoorDash has deals or offers for 50% off. I get $30 off regularly. | I live farther downtown but when I’m in HK I pick up a number of things at Westerly. Not cheap but a wide variety and their sales are good. | Here's your answer OP. I also like to hit up TJs on a slow day for easy freezer dinners. I'll take the E train all the way to Spring Street if I feel like loading up at TJs because the UWS location is hell.

I'll add that I like to go once a month to ALDI in East Harlem to load up on meat and freeze it as well as onions and potatos. Whole Foods has the cheapest alternative milks and staples under their 365 brand as well as some produce items. I wander into Morton Williams to check if they have any manager specials on meats as well. | Love westerly, but their prices are super inflated. | Food Emporium has the worst produce imo. It all goes bad so fast. | Fairway was very close too. Then there is a big jump. | I wish you could check online when you just need one thing or two. I'm doubtful that prices on Uber and Instacart are close to in person pricing. | That is a terrific tip, thank you | this

I used to get the groupon and buy the most expensive items and get 40 or 50% off, I miss the before times. | Yeah I switched jobs and I’m not in HK as much anymore so I haven’t been since like 2022 so I’m sure it could have got worse with prices. I remember it seeming fair and better than Whole Foods. I remember one thing that was a good price, was buy 1 get 50% off all vitamins always. | never had any issues personally with the one on 49th/8th or 43rd/10th. but I guess YMMV

he was also asking for the best value/groceries otherwise I would have suggested Amish Market or Whole Foods | I think all have online sites to see their prices. It gets a bit tedious to search all and compare prices though. | Anytime, love sharing a life hack! | Damn, that’s before my time. That sounds amazing though. | Oh for sure, I think you answered their question. Just my input on Food Emporium. Which I think has a better selection than the Amish market, which imo doesn’t have much better produce."

Okonomiyaki Near MOMA/Central Park/Radio City Music Hall?,"Headed to NYC in December, and I had some Okonomiyaki for the first time in Chicago last year that was incredible. We have nothing like it here in Tampa so I wanted to try and track a joint down for it in NYC while we're checking out the city during Christmas time. We're staying around MOMA/Central park/Radio City Music hall. Does anyone have any good Okonomiyaki in the area to get for lunch?","Izakaya Mew is a little walk away on 35th! Awesome place. I introduced my boyfriend to the okonomiyaki just this Saturday and he loved it! They have many other great dishes too. So yummy. | Donburiya, Izakaya Toribar and Lucky Cat all have it (though only for dinner menu). You could try asking Donburiya (they're the only one open for lunch) if they can do it for you. | Sake Bar Hagi | Not near but izakaya Nomad does it for me | As mentioned, many izakayas serve it, but we are sadly lacking in okonomiyaki specialist restaurants. I’m guessing you might have gone to Gaijin in Chicago? To my knowledge, we don’t really have a place like that. | Sunrise Mart is a popular Japanese lunch spot.  It ain't fancy, but gets it done. | Oh I can definitely go here! I can just hop on the train while the wife is napping with the baby. Thank you!! Anything else on the menu we should try? I love that they put pics of the food on their menu. I eat with my eyes. | Not op but thank you. I have friends visiting and wanting to do all the touristy places and this looks so good. Midtown usually feels like a desert for good moderately priced food. | Came here to say Donburiya | Dang. We're already going to Cafe China Saturday and then Lucali on Sunday for dinner lol was hoping I could find a place that makes it for lunch. | Yep! That’s the place I went to but I just got the traditional Okonomiyaki because it was my first time, nothing specialty. | Yeah I don't like midtown for food but I'll have to stay close by while my wife naps with the baby haha. All'Antico near Times Square has some of my favorite sandwiches in the world and Adel's Halal is nearby too -- the best Halal I've ever had. I'll be getting that Friday night when we get into the city. | I meant that Gaijin specializes in okonomiyaki, so they make a better one than a typical izakaya. It’s similar to how you’d usually expect better ramen from a ramen restaurant than from a Japanese restaurant that happens to serve ramen. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it, but I’m just tempering your expectations."

Danbo may edge it out in terms of quality, but Naruto is a fun little spot and you can sit at the ""bar"" and watch them prepare the ramen. One other thought: it's not a restaurant, but if your daughter likes Japanese products there's a really fun Japanese grocery store called Midoriya just steps from Barclay's. They've got tons of Japanese candy and a great selection of gifts, toys, etc. | Momo ramen is really close! And kyuramen is a chain but the one by Barclays is a good location | Seconding Ramen Danbo | I'd go for Chuko over Kyuramen and Danbo.

There's only one Chuko location, it's local, and they've been around for \~15 years. It gets my vote if OP is not in the Barclay area very often.

Danbo has a great bowl of ramen but it's a chain and they have a (for most people) more accessible location in the West Village. There's also like 5 different Kyuramen locations scattered around the city."
Lumlum vs Pure Thai vs Chalong. Which would be the best for a fun date? ,So I’m going on a date Friday night in Times Square and these three looked like the best options that’ll be near where we’ll be. Tough pick for me cause I’ve never been to any of them and I can see all 3 have got a lot of good reviews. ,"cha long. chef nate limwong also worked on FIsh Cheeks and Soothr which are some of the best Thai spots in the city. food is really good there. 

i'd also pick ThongLor over the other two. really small but awesome decor and food is A+ | IMP, Pure Thai and lum lum are equally delicious and cute 🥰 have fun! | All three places are nice and you can't go wrong with any of them.

Pure Thai - iirc they don't take reservations so you might have to wait in line for 20+ minutes to get seated for dinner. The food is really good, but focus in on the noodles. Service is quick, but the space is pretty cozy.

ChaLong - my fave from the list. You can make reservation there, so won't have to wait. The food is amazing and you can try things you've never had before. Cocktails are fun there as well. The ambiance is pretty romantic, but it's pretty loud inside. I felt like this place is the most pretentious from the list.

Lumlum - I was not impressed with food (but it was still good). The space is pretty cure, but cramped. | Loved LumLum, took my parents there and they were raving. Both LumLum and Chalong are a little more seafood focused, Chalong especially does not have a lot of non-seafood options.

Chalong's chef used to work at Soothr, so similar influences. Very cute custom cocktails, a much more limited menu than the other two but delicious and interesting takes on dishes.

Pure Thai is more classic thai dishes most people are familiar with and very well executed.

Both Pure Thai & Chalong are pretty small. LumLum isn't too much bigger but tables are nicely spaced out.

I recommend making a res in advance for any of them but LumLum particularly, I was able to walk into Pure & Chalong. 

I'd say LumLum if you want out of the box, Chalong if you want seafood and drinks, Pure Thai if you want classic & cozy. | Lumlum is tasty. Very small and no real vibes fyi | Pure thai is the tastiest | Pure Thai! | Pure Thai | What about Saitong?"

NYC Fine Dining with Chinese-speaking staff?,"Hi everyone - bit of a specific question here. 

I'm hoping to take my (Chinese) grandma somewhere nice; she's never had a fine dining experience in the US and I would love to treat her. The issue is she doesn't speak English and my own Chinese is not good enough to be able to fluidly translate the menu, dishes, etc., especially as its being served up. I also don't want her to feel let in the dark as to what's being served - the waitstaff is going to explain each dish coming up and she won't understand.

Are there any fine dining spots (doesn't have to be Michelin) in NYC that might have bilingual / Chinese speaking staff or feel accessible to an elderly Chinese grandma that doesn't speak English?

In terms of taste, she obviously enjoys Asian food (no sushi though), and pastas. Not a big steak person.

Thanks in advance!","The service manager Annie at Restaurant Yuu is native Chinese and I'm sure if noted on the reservation would be more than happy to explain all the dishes in mandarin! | Per Se and EMP both have had Chinese speaking staff on hand to cater to tourists. I’m sure other high end restaurants have the same. No guarantees your grandma would enjoy the food, although she would probably love the gesture.

Otherwise, Hutong would likely have staff or have easily recognizable dishes for you to order. | Atomix had at least 2 mandarin speaking staff when I was there - although I’m not sure if it’s the norm. 2 star Korean tasting menu.

Edit: I read too quickly, I see that you don't necessarily want to take her to a Chinese restaurant. | Cafe China is my favorite high-end Chinese place in the city and potentially one of my favorites period.

Just a thought! | If you guys like Korean I’d recommend Oiji Mi- michelin star and definitely a great experience. When I went for mothers day 2 years ago it was also predominantly asian families (im chinese too) and there were poc front of house so we never felt out of place. | You must not be from NY because we have tons of Chinese speaking people/wait staff in restaurants | I was going to recommend Hutong as well for a high-end Chinese experience in a beautiful space. | There's a clear bias in Michelin ratings against both Italian and Chinese in NYC. I wouldn't stress the stars so much. Hutong is VERY tasty (esp for duck), and a unique experience for NY. 

There's also a fine dining Chinese restaurant in flushing, I believe an export from Shanghai or HK. But I can't remember the name. It opened a couple years ago. I have a note but I can't for the life of me remember the name. | They do great presentation and really put on a show for their Peking duck (full, not half, though) | I just recommend hwa yuan its really a very nice experience. | A lot of the middle tier priced omakase spots in town are run by Fujian folks! | This used to be one of my favorite spots in the city.   After my last couple of meals there, I’m sad to say I see why they lost their Michelin star. The food just isn’t the same. | Yeah I'd call Cafe China to see if they could accommodate her! | I wouldn't consider Grandma's Home to be fine dining. | Pass.

I kept walking past it this summer and it looked like a good spot. I learned they’re a chain with over 200 locations in China. I eventually tried it and unfortunately almost every dish was mediocre. It reminded me of a Chinese Applebee’s. The service was friendly enough.

No real reason to dine there when there are so many better Chinese options in NYC. | Probably Juqi. | Yeah, not sure I’d give it a Michelin star if I were starting fresh, but that’s a bit of anchoring bias to how good they used to be. Still highly enjoyable imo | I had two good meals there… but I guess I have bad taste becuase I also like DTF | Yes! Thank you. Have you been? I'd like to try it... | I have not. I had some friends go and thought it was average so I haven't been able to get a group together."
Rate my food itinerary and recommend specific dishes (2 days in NYC)!,"I'll be visiting this weekend and staying in lower Manhattan, so I've limited my food journey to just a few nearby areas.

3. Noodle Pudding - we'll be spending some time walking around the Brooklyn Heights area, and this seemed like a good dinner option nearby
4. Manhatta (anniversary dinner; I mentioned I wanted a window seat when I made the reservation and they said no promises. If there are more surefire ways to secure one, let me know!)

6. Szechuan Mountain House","3. I live in BH and Noodle Pudding is fine. Nothing amazing. I think you can do a bit better in this area. Lilo Cucina looks awesome but I’ve yet to go | Noodle üudding is good (cash only) - if you want alternative options: river deli, popina (bit more southern) or venture towards cobble hill for Spanish cuisine (la vara) | At Bar Goto, the food is also amazing- they're small portions, get the celery.

Attaboy is great- be prepared to wait unless you show up at/before 5. also, bring your nightvision goggles if you want to see your date. its v dark in there but def a vibe. almost feels like a ramen shop where you have an intimate moment (or two or three) with your cocktail and then leave, not really a place to linger and chat with empty glasses. | Manhatta is great for drinks, when I went with my boyfriend at the time the food was incredible mediocre for the price point. I’d recommend saga instead, it’s very close with similar views and much better food with an amazing cocktail bar called overstory above it. 
For cocktail bars I would add death & co, mace, Tigre, angels share, and patent pending. | LILO is awesome but small space so would be tough to score a table"

Nice walk in lunch for two pregnant best friends with accessible parking ,"I know it’s oddly specific, and very last minute, as it is for TODAY but I am meeting my bestie, and I just realized - for the last time in a next few months. I and due in a month, and she is three months behind me. Want to make it special.

We are open to any food except undercooked meat and mercury heavy fish. I will be driving in as walking anything more than a block or two is quite a hike for me now. So need to have street parking available or some other reasonable parking option. Proximity to Chelsea is a plus

🙏","The parking is the challenge here. | This is less about food and more about parking: you could book at a hotel with a decent restaurant and valet parking eg. The Four Seasons seems to have it, according to their website. | Not new and shiny but prioritizing your ask for parking… There’s a parking lot across the street from Cookshop and you can make reservations! | If you’re open to paid lots / garages there’s a fair amount of parking near Hudson yards, and you could walk into Zou Zou’s for lunch! | There are several great restaurants in Hudson yards. Hudson yards itself is pretty bleh but I think parking shouldn’t be a problem as there are many lots nearby. Ci Siamo does lunch, though I’m not sure how walking in would go. But there are a few others as well so I think something should work. | Use SpotHero and you can book a garage for a good price. | Bar primi in penn district has a few parking lots within a block or two and sometimes there is street parking on 33rd or 9th ave | Drive into Astoria you can park near Ditmars or 23 Ave | Use bestparking app. 

You can reserve parking on the app. Usually you save $. 

And no worries about lot being full if you have a reservation. | Cookshop in Chelsea has a lot across the street! | Cookshop -parking nearby. | Yeah, why not use Uber? | Another vote for Hudson Yards, I might just do that, someone told me Milo’s has a good lunch | I live near there and am continually surprised by how good that place is. The pizzas are legit and my wife loves the spicy Caesar. Also when did spicy Caesar salads show up at literally every Italian restaurant in the city? | So how was lunch? | I am a Jersey girl 🥲 | If you cant get a table at Estiatorio Milos - the proper upstairs restaurant -- there is another one downstairs, Milos Wine Bar, with a more limited menu.  You should have no issue getting a table there. I like both a lot. | Pier 57 is also a good choice, the garage is in the same building as the food court and the Mexican restaurant, and also City Winery has lunch. And you can take the elevator to the rooftop park and sit for a bit afterwards. Chelsea Piers also has parking in the same building, and there’s a restaurant in the golf pier - The Water Hazard. | Great! Also saw someone mention Zou Zou. I went there for a bday dinner and it was top notch. Have a nice time! | Try using SpotHero to get guaranteed parking garage rates. Or look at Hell’s Kitchen — personally feel like that’s the easiest neighborhood to get street parking in Manhattan. | So you’re the one who talked Hochul out of congestion pricing | And? You’re not looking for lunch there. Adapt. Manhattan doesn’t revolve around you. | Damn. Kinda unnecessarily harsh | They’re pregnant and looking for advice. Will it kill you to be kinder? Jfc. | Adapt in which way? Spend $200+ on uber? Drive in, still look for a parking elsewhere and then get uber? | Throw it in a garage and uber anywhere you want. What you want is valet parking and it doesn’t exist here. | Plenty of places in Manhattan have valet parking | >What you want is valet parking and it doesn’t exist here.

A ton of restaurants in Brooklyn and Queens have valet parking. | Very cool to know. Can you list some of them, please? | And? We’re talking about Manhattan. Chelsea was mentioned. | Cipriani, and also any restaurant in a hotel. I live in midtown, a lot of high end places here have valet. | The sub is for all five boros of NYC and OP says proximity to Chelsea is a plus, not a requirement. | Come on, you know she means Manhattan.  Chelsea or Kew Gardens?  Or City Island?  You feel free to share some ideas in Douglaston though."

Festive Dinner in December ,"Hello all—
Used to live in NYC but having been out for 7 years I’m not feeling too up on the dining scene. Hopefully you can help recommend a fun, festive dinner spot for 4 either Flatiron or Chelsea. Not looking to break the bank but not on a shoestring budget either. I was thinking something along the lines of a Gramercy Tavern, if that makes sense.

Thanks in advance! ","Eataly in flatiron would be festive I believe, I’m sure they’ll have all the xmas stuff inside"
Best Hot Chocolate in each borough?,"In anticipation of cooler weather, where are the best places to get hot chocolate from any of the 5 boroughs? ","How do you like your hot chocolate? Sweet and indulgent? A little bitter? Spiced?

I’ll throw one in for Queens from Masa Madre:

>	Chocolate Mexicano vanilla bean, semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon

Brooklyn - Fan Fan Doughnuts 

>	Belgium style hot chocolate with toasted marshmallows and doughnut croutons | My house (Manhattan) | No Chewing Allowed stall in the Bryant Park holiday market. Rich and delicious. | Manhattan:

* Angelina Paris - Bryant Park outpost of a famous Parisian restaurant/patisserie well known for their hot chocolate and whipped cream.  While you can get it to go, I feel like that's missing the point.  I encourage splitting a pot w/ a friend over a pastry.  My favorite (their food is also shockingly good, and incredibly rich).
* Bryant Park Holiday Market - There's always a dozen options, but my favorite is there year round at Wafles and Dinges, but still worth walking around and trying other places if you're into that.
* La Maison du Chocolat - Another famous place from France, I was ultimately not overly impressed when compared against the price (and it's the most affordable thing they sell, their prices terrify me).
* Mariebelle - I haven't been yet but people rave about it.
* Jacques Torres and Max Brenner should be mentioned for being local places.  I'm not really a fan of either, but people love them.

My association of hot chocolate is clearly w/ holiday markets, and the Bryant park one is my favorite.

Rip City Bakery for those of y'all that love marshmallows in your hot chocolate. | Thanks to thecarboholic, here's every Hot Chocolate across 5 boroughs rated with notes - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PivG-KsgBv\_CuUXg8moAejngd0AXNn9EA5NN2NSCs9U/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PivG-KsgBv_CuUXg8moAejngd0AXNn9EA5NN2NSCs9U/edit?gid=0#gid=0) | For Brooklyn, I do enjoy Not Just Chocolate. They use real chocolate pieces in their drinks!

For Manhattan: if he makes it back to the city, Maury Rubin's The Color of Chocolate pop up is a must! To me its not overly sweet, but rich and has a good chocolate taste throughout. If not there, there is also Blue Stripes Cacao Bar , Mah-Ze-Dahr bakery which offer a similar taste profile imo.  Or for a more Parisian take (super thick and rich, there is also Angelina's. | Mariebelle’s my favorite in NYC, but I sat down—idk how different the hot chocolate experience is if you order to go. Angelina’s solid, too, though. The others are more average in my experience (still good—just not as good as the others!). | For Queens, Cannelle Patisserie has the perfect hot chocolate, in my opinion. Rich, but not too thick or sweet, and supremely sippable! | I like sugar hill creamery’s hot chocolate. It’s made out of ice cream and they add torched marshmallow fluff on top. Not as much of a rich chocolate taste as the others so it depends on what you want | Aigner- queens
Fanfan doughnut -Brooklyn 
Venchi Manhattan | Manhattan- rigor hill 
Brooklyn- Brooklyn farmacy 

I really truly thought both of these were just tik tok famous and not going to be worth it but they so are | Blue Stripes Cacao Bar for Manhattan | Everything I’ve had from masa madre has been delicious, can’t wait to try the hot chocolate! | lol I hate the name of No Chewing Allowed so much, but they do have great product. | Maury Rubin, the creator of City Bakery, had a hot chocolate popup at one of the Urban Space food courts near Grand Central last year. Not sure if he's doing it again this year but maybe something to keep an eye on.

[The Color of Chocolate](https://www.instagram.com/_colorofchocolate_/?hl=en)'s latest post says he's doing a popup later this week in Toronto at some Winter Village so here's hoping that he'll do another one in NYC this winter. | Jacques was really hyped. I went to the one in Grand Central and found it to be decent at best; even that seems generous | Getting it to go and walking around and window shopping in soho for a date night is really nice. Their to go cups keep it pretty warm for a while | Worth trying everything at Masa Madre! Hope you like the hot chocolate too! | He was part of the first wave of celebrity chef/food obsession here in NYC (he opened in 2000 in Brooklyn), so it's sorta important, but the majority of what they sell is just 'good' at this point.  They were one of the first 'premium' hot chocolate powders I remember seeing (at that point, please just make your own).

The truffles are really great, just not $2.50 a pop great (a good gift for someone who really likes stuff like that though). | That makes sense. So sort of like a Levain in a way? Like 10-15 years ago, was some grade A stuff but now has delved into just decent"

You’re putting together a good NYC food gift basket; what to include?,"Recipient would be a well-off but non-snobby foodie who had to leave NYC a few years ago. Obviously, I’m not thinking of including much/anything from Eataly. Leaning more towards pantry items (though I’m open to exceptions) and beverages that are simply hard to come by outside of NYC. Could be anything from a tin of macerated caviar zest that’s only available at a random shop in the Statue of Liberty (whatever) to a hard-to-find soda that only certain bodegas carry. The only theme is “It’s tough to find this outside of NYC.”","""Send a salami to your boy in the army!"" from Katz's.

I used to send a yearly box of olives/pickles/cheeses/biscuits from Sahadi's on Court Street in Brooklyn. Always appreciated.

I sent my mom a Zabar's pastrami fixings box last xmas. She loved it.

Edited to add products from Eataly | Did they have any favorite restaurants or coffee shops while living in NYC? They might have merch, pantry goods, or bagged beans for sale.

Depending where they live now, are there foods they miss that are easier to find in NYC?

Some ideas:

-	bagels, babka, black and white cookies
-	chili oil and hot sauce from local producers (Nowon, 886, Queen Majesty, etc)
-	check out shops like Pearl River Food Mart and Heatonist for more local goods
-	this NY [“We Are Happy To Serve You” mug](https://store.moma.org/products/new-york-coffee-cup-blue?)
-	pantry goods from different cultures that may be hard to find where they live now (Sahadi’s, Japan Village, Tashkent, H Mart, Yun Hai, 3 Aunties Mart, Mogmog, Zaragoza, Kalustyan’s, Phil-Am Mart) | I'm lazy, so I'd just send a Zabar's basket and call it a day, but if you want to put in a little effort and get some stuff individually, here are a few ideas:

* Zabar's coffee
* Black and white cookies from Orwasher's or William Greenberg
* Manhattan Special Espresso Soda (I think this tastes terrible, but some people like it)
* A hard salami and a jar of house mustard from Katz's
* Dried fruit or a jar of spice mix from Kalyustan's
* A tin of Russ & Daugter's caviar
* ~~Utz's chips~~ Hal's Kettle Chips | * Spices - stores such as **SOS Chefs** or **Kalustyan's**. SOS Chef especially has some extremely unique items and they stock many restaurants around the city. 

* Go to the **Union Square Farmer's Market** - you can find spirits, honeys (including the honeys made and labeled by neighborhood - Andrew's Honey), jams, hot sauces, lotions, pretzels, etc.

* King of Falafel sells their own dry falafel mix

* [Restaurant or brewery merch](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/10uqzkp/which_restaurants_sell_tshirts/)

The [""Send Chinatown Love"" cookbook](https://www.vogue.com/article/made-here-send-chinatown-love-cookbook) that was made last year. It has a lot of Asian/Chinese recipes from local NYC restaurants.

Some vacuum sealed beef jerky from Chinatown. Most places will vacuum seal it for free as long as you buy over a certain amount.

Chinese sausage/cured pork belly from [Sun Ming Jan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cxqUckkEQhs9xH8c7).

Fat Witch bakery in Chelsea Market sells brownie kits.

If you're going for coffee beans, [SEY ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/c6Edoayp38XmegCw5)is probably the most popular NYC roaster for coffee snobs.

Maybe some Japanese goodies from [Minamoto Kitchoan](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VUR9E7jG3SmuEjSR8)? I think they're a Japanese chain, but all their US locations are in NYC or Cali so I'll quantify it as hard to find.

I remember seeing multiple posts from people visiting from London asking where to find restaurants that gives you the Chinese takeout boxes you see on TV. If they are from England/Europe, I'd stash all the goodies in this [Chinese Take out hand bag from Pearl River Mart](https://pearlriver.com/products/bewaltz-chinese-take-out-box-handbang).

3-5 is not off brand usually, just means that you're in times square or you're getting ripped off. You can haggle in New York, especially if youre getting multiple. Handing them a 5 and saying can I get one peanut one cashew even if the prices are listed higher will often work. 

I say 3-5 is too expensive because if you're near a nutz4nutz that has those prices you're probably near another one with the 'correct' prices. | Hm I thought it was a better deal but I guess I'm a sucker lol (I'm not from NY so that checks out) | Any of the nut carts you can smell long before you can see it is a good deal, especially if you are just visiting. 

Pro tip: get a few extra and freeze them. Eat a frozen bag later just to try to frozen, and then put a different bag on vanilla bean (super premium or premium) ice cream | I never thought of freezing cause I usually eat them all quick lol. But that sounds like a better method.  
  
As for the icecream, I shall try that one day.  
  
Thank you!"

Yelp “Critic” writes a negative review of Ikigai and the business responds with their narrative based on video footage,"I’m impressed by the professional response from Ikigai. When I see responses from businesses on Yelp, they’re usually verbally attacking the reviewer or asking the reviewer to contact the business to set up a comped follow up visit. It’s also more transparent than trying to censor the review by paying Yelp for deletion. ","I love how the owner had RECEIPTS. Such a detailed, yet professional takedown.

This really sucks though - the restaurant looks fairly new so I imagine the reviewer (Tori S) thought she could get a comped meal off of writing a crappy (and completely false) review.

EDIT: Also, it's kind of weird to pick a Japanese kaiseki restaurant for your anniversary with your partner who's allergic to peanuts, salmon, and salmon roe? | This is the kind of energy we need. Proof, receipts, timeline!!! | Damn for the final course he cooked and served Tori S 😭 | Just to add some additional context, Ikigai operates as a non-profit, with all profits going to an organization that addresses food insecurity. The owner and team behind the restaurant are awesome people bringing some much-needed positivity to the world, which makes what this “critic” tried to do all the more terrible. The class exemplified by the owner in responding to the review was remarkable, and a testament to the restaurant’s values. | Thanks!  That review ruined my whole day. It's incredible how quickly one person's review changes everything. For example, before that review, we were 5.0 on Resy and one of the few highest rated restaurants on Resy in all of NYC. | This user got cooked hotter than the wagyu at 425. Dayum | Only 5 star reviews on Google. This place sounds 🔥. | She has 3 reviews and all negative. She's always fishing for that free meal.  People like her are terrible for small businesses. All that so she can selfishly get comped.   The owner has a play by play refuting all her BS. | Mentioning at the end that they ate all of it is nasty work. Good for them! | I live around the corner from a strip mall thai place that blew up in a big way after it got written up by a famous food critic. To be clear, this place rules.

Suddenly there were so many low-star reviews from people with 789 yelp reviews (super reviewers!) with big opinions about how thai cuisine is supposed to presented, the service, the ambiance, etc. Most of said reviewers are from towns 10-20 miles away. This is a restaurant in a strip mall that also has a 7-11 and Pizza Hut.

Most Yelp reviewers are just people who loved creative writing class but never had the talent to get off the ground. Writing about food in an interesting, meaningful way is hard. | Just want to say I’ve eaten there and it was an incredible experience!! We went the first week they opened and can’t wait to go back. | Fantastic response from the owner. Can't argue with time line... | r/MurderedByWords | My partner and I celebrated our anniversary at Ikigai as well and we loved it. We recieved champagne also but near the end of the meal. Almost all of the food was finished and plated in front of everyone, especially the wagyu. The cooks were skillful and the waitstaff highly attentive, this takedown is proof of that. | So satisfying coming with the receipts! | Love this from the owner 👏👏👏 | The “critic” lost me with their inability to use the shift key. I wrote them off before I even saw the receipts. | I was at Ikigai a few weeks ago and everything was amazing im surprised they would have any lapse in service this way- they literally only have like 12 diners at a time. 

The owner also took the time to speak to each diner after the service so also weird they held their tongue just to write a review, just communicate!! | Ikigai is awesome and so is the owner! For the
Menu, it is extremely reasonably priced. Their drinks are highly underrated (esp, the one about the captain and ship?). Highly recommend | Ikigai by far the best restaurant I’ve been to all year in nyc. Superior on every level | my bf and I were lucky to try Ikigai a couple weeks ago, and it was outstanding. The service was really impeccable and no detail was too small. 

For example, I switched my chopsticks the other way bc I'm left handed, and they noticed and started positioning things on my left side or replacing my chopstick position also on the left. Once I noticed, I was floored. 

Highly recommend! | Great response by the restaurant but really sad it was necessary.  Yelp used to be my go to as usually reviews were honest/instructive/had details for me to make up my own mind. Kind of like chowhound back in the days. 

Now it seems Yelp is trying to force restaurant owners to purchase advertising packages and such. This may be what is encouraging these self-serving reviews, false negatives? Yelp is no longer reliable to me. 

Bleah. They were great for a while. | People like this suck for small businesses. We need a culture of writing good reviews more often to combat people like this.

Amazing that the owner had receipts and served such a respectful response to this nonsense. | Boom roasted! And in such a classy professional manner | Savage | If you want to learn the truth about yelp, look up the movie Billion Dollar Bully……

Or the South Park episode that skewers yelpers…….. | I have a reservation to go this week and am super excited to try it out! I love what the restaurant stands for and I'm sure they work very hard to ensure everyone enjoys their experience. This person needs to eat at home if they can't act decently towards hard working people. | “Tori S” sounds amazingly fun at parties | dam well played | Thanks for putting this on my radar. Looks fantastic. | lol this is an amazing restaurant, glad they’re defending themselves! | I feel bad for her husband. Happy anniversary | Support the business, they sound delicious 😋  | A masterclass response. | It’s to build a case for charge back | Love when a person stands up to a bully. Using non-violent communication, for the bonus points, no less.  | I F’N LOVE WHEN YOU HAVE RECEIPTS.  It’s my favorite thing at work. | Respect. Def going there now | Cooked 💀 | Going to make a reservation here. Thanks for the recommendation! Looks and sounds dank. Sorry you decided to be upset with your meal.

Just realized you were showing the review, not the ""critic"" | Looks like Tori S. Got caught in 4k | Yelp really needs to have a better system. It’s annoying that people leave bad reviews and you check their profile it’s nothing but 1 stars. Just say you’re fishing for free food and go. | This is so good!!! | Yelp reviewers are trash. Sad that restaurants have to rely on it to a degree. Family Guy did a great parody on the uselessness of yelp reviews | Oh shizzzz. Came with receipts 🧾 | I kind of hope this is some guerrilla marketing | This was such a great read. And then I find out this place is 3 blocks from me. I walk by it everyday… had no idea.

Beyond excited to tell my wife about this luck encounter and book a res. See you soon @Dan_at_Ikigai! | I love this thorough dismantling! | how did they know exactly who Tori S is and what day and time they were there...? I guess maybe Tori made the review the night of or the very next day? And they like asked all the servers to see who this was? | I am so happy for this restaurant. This absolute wagon's make-believe review has generated so much positivity (and hopefully revenue through bookings) for a small business with a beautiful ethos. Congratulations on meeting Tori S, Dan. | How much is the omakase here? 300? | Owner had time today! | Well now I’m going to try and go here based on this haha! Thanks, Tori S.! | Some idiot made a recent account just to rant. I would never trust reviews from people who have written so little | Buuuuuurn! | Reading the menu in the Yelp review response, I can’t wait to go here. | Can't wait to check out this place next time I'm in the city!!! | There has never been a person that I have interacted with who has used the term “umami” unironically that I have not considered an unabashed dickhead. | Ah... social media gaslighting and bs shaming and now the Streisand effect.

The Yelper was clearly dissociating from their miserable life. | Snap! | I’m going to go to this restaurant :) | Lmao this is HILARIOUS. | Justice is a dish, best served cold. 
But A5 wagyu is best served warm, like at Ikigai

Edit: someone complaining when they ate everything is always a red flag... | WORD!!!! | But W for the owner of the business! | This is incredible. I’ll have to check it out soon. | They have 37 reviews on google and EVERY SINGLE ONE is 5 stars and raving. Their story doesn’t add up from the start | Fuck Tori S! Fuck Tori S! Fuck Tori S! | She lost all credibility with me by using resy. I also want to visit the restaurant. Sounds amazing. | Usually those account with three reviews get taken down anyways for being unreliable. But this is hilarious on the owners part | Mic drop Ikigai! Let’s see Tori defend herself now | Wait...so she just completely lied about everything that happened?  | Just had to google where this place is. NYC is a yearly visit for me and it looks like I’ll be going to Fort Greene when I get there next time. | No cuz I’m going here after this clap back. Hats off to the owner | ATE and left no crumbs | Props to the owner | This should be in r/murderedbywords | This is how an owner’s follow up should look. Simply facts. No emotions and yet still courteous. | I'll be in NYC next month, eating here because that response is amazing. | What in the gen-z is a “resy”??? 😂😂 | Holy crow, you’re not far from me at all! My hubby and I need to come here! | And this is why I would never open a restaurant. People suck. | This made me want to eat here ASAP | The owner makes me want to go here. Points for how kind his response was. He even thanked her at least twice: for choosing his restaurant and eating all the food. Bravo | Wow, impressive response! In NY and bookmarked your spot😮‍💨 | The most Japanese READ ever. | I’ll see you in December u/Dan_at_Ikigai ! | This makes me want to visit Ikigai! Adding it to my omakase list! | The only thing that negative review and the response did was motivate me to go there. | And did Yelp take it down?    Yelp is awful stop using it. | As soon as I saw the word ""resy"" I knew this would be one insufferable bitch.  | Great professional response laying out all the facts, actually surprised to see the review still up because I thought false reviews weren’t allowed on Yelp. | How do you even know what the owner is saying is true? I got sick at a restaurant from the fish once and the owner on yelp lied and harrased the shit out of me. 

There is no linked video here. | [removed] | I will say the owner listing all the food has made me hungry and everything they wrote sounds delicious! lol | I have a strong feeling the allergies may be her first course of action to try to get a comped meal. Especially seeing how it's mentioned in the very beginning of her review as she is setting the tone of how the restaurant fumbled from the start (even though they didn't). 

She knows what she's doing, lying sack of sh\*t. | Seems like she was picking what she wanted and not what they could enjoy together | You might be surprised to hear that about 30% of our guests have allergies and dietary restrictions. We design a different menu for each guest based on their dietary restrictions. I think we are one of the few chefs counter prix fixe meals that accommodate almost all dietary restrictions (not Vegan), so groups of mixed dietary restrictions are attracted to our restaurant, and we love to accommodate. | I want reviews to have actual receipts. Reviews should be (anonymously) attributed and tracked to some provenance. I don't care who you are - I want it to be anonymous - but there needs to be some validation process. Otherwise, garbage in garbage out. It's just information theory | You’d be surprised how many people would come to the Japanese restaurant where I worked who were allergic to shrimp/shellfish…couldn’t even have stuff fried in the same oil and would start asking us to change the oil for our giant tempura fryer to accommodate their allergy 😒 | lol. She thought the brown butter was uni. She needs to stop going to Japanese restaurants. | [removed] | This is so good, I need a Vida and a Diet Coke | Thanks! 🙏 | My people 🥲 | this salt lake city reference is taking me OUT | 👏👏👏👏 | The omakase course taken to a whole new level | Thanks, I appreciate the kind words.  This bad, albeit bs, review was so bad for team morale.  The kindness in this thread helps a lot | The food insecurity comment was finely executed. My pallet was immediately greeted with flavors of virtuosity on the owner’s part followed by notes of passion, bordering on gluttony, toward the reviewer. | You handled it wonderfully! Hopefully, more owners take your approach. | Great to see you on here as well. Sorry to see this happen, I’ve heard great things about you guys and been meaning to check you out. As someone who used to work for Yelp (ugh), I’ve never seen anyone handle a negative review so perfectly and gracefully. | I have a friend that owns a bakery and she laments BS like this.  But there’s really nothing you can do to fight it except what you did.  Some people just suck. | We got your back! It’s clear that review was dishonest and had an agenda. Great job the way you handled it. | Because of how well you handled this, I'm adding your restaurant to my to-do list. Hope to see you soon! | If it helps, I trust 4.9 establishments more than 5.0 because I know that people like this reviewer exist, so a 5.0 seems suspicious (is the business very new? are they paying to delete bad reviews?)

Also second what everyone else is saying in this thread, extremely classy response on your part!!! | Owner was on fire, however the reviewer complained that their response was served stone cold. | I was going to say. At least the person is still on yelp and hasn’t figured out google is really where most people review now. First thing I did was google them and saw the 5 lol | It is, I went a week or two after they'd opened with some friends and then immediately went back a few weeks later for my own anniversary dinner. Highly recommend, and great people there. | I was honestly shocked to read the initial review as my husband and I came here also for our anniversary. The tea room was such a nice touch since with our ever so unreliable subways, most ppl can be 15 to 20 minutes late.

The experience was very nice as I loved the fusion touches in the course as based on the owner's own travels and background. They even gave us free drinks at the end to celebrate our anniversary. Glad to see they came with receipts. | That's why I don't use Yelp.

It's full of wannabe influencers cosplaying as food critics who think that giving overly harsh reviews mean they have a refined palette. | tbf one of those reviews is a 5 star review for a tanning salon and the other one (that isn’t this one) is for a darkroom she claimed charged her for photos she never got back. i think “she’s always fishing for that free meal” based off of those reviews might be a stretch. loved the clap back the owner gave to this review tho. | They also said they loved it.  🤷‍♂️ | Yeah, some people gotta remember context for stuff. It's still hilarious how you'll see some bad reviews for hole in the wall restaurants because of things like cramped seating. | Any time a restaurant is featured on ""reality"" tv, it is bombarded with negative reviews that act like they were present for the filming. | So much has changed! And thanks for enduring the heat outside in our garden that week.  Looking forward to seeing you again! | For real tho | Thank you for choosing to celebrate your anniversary at Ikigai. Thanks for your kind words.  And who doesn't love that wagyu?! | Thanks 🙏 | That's the most frustrating part.  They said they loved the meal.  The husband said the wagyu was his favorite ""but, everything was great"" | Thanks 🙏 | 🙏🥹❤️ | Awww... Thank you for noticing ❤️ | This isn't a recent thing. Yelp (the company) has always been incredibly shady.

They use aggressive sales tactics and basically extort money out of local restaurants by forcing them to pay to remove/hide false negative reviews and to receive visibility. | Please and thank you! | Yay! Seeya then! And you'll get to see, first hand, how we accommodate dietary restrictions for your husband.  ❤️ | [deleted] | Thanks 🙏 | Just doing my best to support honesty and the team | But there's no video | Seeya soon! 🙏 | The meal is prepaid on Resy.  We know the name of every party that sat at the restaurant and what seat they are in.  In this case, the person that made the review is the same person that booked the reservation.  We only sit 144 guests per week. | $165. Last week it was 15 courses. | It’s 165 a person it’s a pretty competitive omakase price. I live in the neighborhood and I’m vaguely sad a burger spot got priced out of the neighborhood and replaced with a swanky omakase spot but it’s nice that they have the focus on food insecurity? I guess? | She almost certainly is talking about the company, Resy. | How do you know it's false? There is no video | If you leave a review, please be truthful.

Eat wherever you want, no judgement.

Many restaurants have cameras for security and accountability. Even McDonald's. | Yes!! Can't believe it also included Wagyu cooked tableside for them too.

From their Resy - a 12 course kaiseki at $165/pp honestly sounds like a really reasonable price, given the number of dishes and the quality of the ingredients and preparation. A little bit more than a run-of-the-mill dinner (at least for me personally lol) but have definitely bookmarked for a future visit once I can convince a friend to join 😂 | I do actually really want to go eat there now lol | Yeah I’m like damn, I can’t wait to try this place!! | Yeah that was a straight-up ad. Worked too; I just added it to my list of places to try | Sometimes people are having a bad day. And, for some reason, restaurants are where they direct that frustration. Really f'ed up my day | idk she only has three reviews since 2021- idk how it works but to never have any at a restaurant and then all of a sudden only make one to try an get a comp? I'd wager someone like that might have at least more than one negative review at a restaurant showing she tries to get comps?

Two negative (incl this one; the other negative one is not a restaurant ) and one good one at a tanning spa. I think ppl who don't write reviews ever might tend to go out of their way only when they are very upset...? | You handled mine extremely well, FTR! | I’m allergic to”some bitter lettuce” but radicchio is fine, can you accommodate? | [removed] | It’s a perfectly cromulent use of the word. | Lisa Barlow is that you? | I just wanted to say that the food insecurity comment was finely executed. 

My pallet was immediately greeted with flavors of virtuosity on the owner’s part followed by notes of passion, bordering on gluttony, toward the reviewer.

Well done, and I hope to try the food sometime soon. | Thank you for noticing Lisaaa 😏 | Funny enough I think I was at this same seating (Sat 7:30) and had a wonderful time. Will definitely be back! | Don't let these people take away from the greatness you are brining into the world! I am making a reservation for my wife and me to support you out of spite for these asses. Good on you and keep fighting the good fight. | Thanks 🥹. I love Reddit ❤️ | Honestly, that helps a lot.  I never thought of it that way.  Thanks! | Most people that still use Yelp is to leave negative reviews. I manage a business and we would get 1 review a year from Yelp and those would be the bad ones. | Hi!!! ❤️❤️❤️ | Maybe up go for my birthday dinner in a few weeks. | 3 reviews with no photo and she's a wannabe influencer? It's just someone who wrote a detailed but off base review. 

I think I've seen more of this on Google if anything, minus the detailed part. | This post has made me want to stop by with my girlfriend, which I shall when I’m able | I'm sad for you guys losing that 5 star streak, but even Disfrutar has 4.8 online. Theres some diners that will never be pleased! 

I don't think i'd be able to forgive saying the rice was overcooked though haha | Damn, that’s messed up! | Girl idk maybe stay off the app if it’s weird to you | I live in the neighborhood also.  That burger place wasn’t good and feels like it’s been closed for years.  

You can get a burger at Walter’s or cafe Paulette or any number of other places.  

I haven’t been to Ikigai yet, but I’m looking forward to it. | Alright check out the omakase and report back  | I read it as short for ""the reservation"". Can I still hate her though? | Using ""the"" in front of it almost assures she was shortening the word ""reservation"" and not referring to the company. To me at least. | Sure , but if you go in NYC expect to get fleeced. And expect the restaurant to be on the defensive from the time you arrive. It's a tuff business that has almost become untenable. Tracking a customers every mo e by timestamp is bullshit. | A5 Miyazaki wagyu, to be exact. For some, it's their favorite course. We like to think we are very reasonably priced relative to the cost of our ingredients.  And, it's definitely not a casual meal, but we look forward to seeing you when you come in! | I'm from Brooklyn, f*ck that review! I'm going to go eat there and spend all the money, just because of how bs that customer was!! | I paid like $95 or something for two bowls of ramen last time I was in New York so this sounds like a great deal! | I’ll be your friend! I’m convinced! | well played though mate. | I'm sorry she fucked up your day, I really am. But I'm glad she posted this and that someone posted here, your restaurant sounds amazing and I'll be booking my reservation on Friday! I didn't even know you guys existed but now I do and I'm excited to visit. | Well played, good sir. A masterclass at professional takedown. 🤣🫶🏼 | Sorry, customers can be assholes - weird detail in their critique that was expertly countered by your prose.

Great job by ""killing them with kindness"".

Just strange all around from allergies to picking your venue. 

Prepaid, maybe it was a gift but to take the time to make up lies means those folks are broken and not worth your attention.

Plus you won reddit! | They either do not understand or are actually fully aware of the power their little negative review holds, especially for a new restaurant, yet still does it to stroke their pretentious, self-inflated ego. 

Seems like they can't even appreciate a delicious meal, hope they enjoys their miserable life. | I hear you! A good review really lifts me up, a bad review really messes with me. | I wonder if she posts negative reviews then offers to remove them once she’s comped. | So glad to hear! | 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏 | [removed] | Congrats, you might be the only comment left under this thread | Palate 👍 | I don't just like it, I LOVE IT | And we love you | Well they really showed you! I do love seeing restaurants stand up for themselves in a respectful way tho! Probably a lot can’t if they are part of a restaurant group or something | The people that leave Yelp reviews are the especially bitter ones. They already left a bad Google review, and they're still mad. So they leave another review on Yelp even though nobody reads Yelp reviews in this decade. | Hi! And thanks again for the great meals :) | When someone tells a Japanese chef that his rice is overcooked, it's a personal attack! Haha! Our Japanese chef in the kitchen was particularly not pleased with that comment. | You seem fun at parties | [deleted] | I mean if you didn't like it that's fine! I had quite a few good burgers (and great brunch) there & it almost always had cheap drinks. It was nice when you were looking for a cheaper meal out, so I'm sad to lose out on one of the few places to grab a meal for under $30 in the neighborhood.  I feel like everywhere else i'm spending 50-70 to get lunch or dinner.  Now an omakase that's minimum 165 has replaced one of the cheapest sit-down spots locally, it just feels like the neighborhood is losing what was left of its accessibility, which i think i personally am allowed to mourn.  I'm also looking forward to trying ikigai! hopefully going soon, but yeah, one can have complex feelings about the fact that a $165 a person restaurant with a focus on food insecurity is replacing a ""cheap eats"" in an expensive neighborhood. | i'm probably going to go for my birthday! (as long as someone else is paying) | It would be rude not to | Yeah, we definitely all hate her. | I don't think they're tracking every single customer by timestamp. They did that here to respond to a bs review to show that the customer was lying. | You earned yourself a customer with that review response. | Well do on on your response! I’m curious if they contacted you afterwards? | Very reasonable! I wish I was in NYC more often to pay you a visit. | Dan the Man!!! Came with the receipts.

I’m recently engaged. Soon as I can get our families in one place, I’m stopping by for celebration. | The wagyu was my favorite course when my husband and I went! We had a fantastic experience :) | Oh wow, you’re the owner!! 

Great response to the Yelp review and the food sounded delicious - if I’m ever in your area, I’m definitely eating at your place!! | Do you remember the name! Just curious. I have a list of ramen places I want to check out 🙃 | You sound amazing and your food sounds delicious - would love to try your place next time I'm in NYC | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | We do, we surely do. | The response is beautiful | As someone who still reads and writes Yelp reviews, Google reviews are worthless, borderline toxic positivity. I've gone to so many ""great"" restaurants and thought WTF just to find the real rating is a 3.5 star on Yelp. | Haha true! I don’t even bother to go to Yelp anymore because it always takes me to the App Store 🤷🏻‍♀️ | Lol damn what an insult to the chef! | [deleted] | Thanks!!!!!! | Nope | Was just trying to look it up. Tonchin by Empire State. | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | This. Exactly this. | The reservation was at 7:30, not 7, and by 8:05, they were on their 3rd course. I'm not sure where you got 7 from. Also, she never complains that they waited 45 minutes for a table. She complains that they waited that long for food, but that is clearly false. They had their first course within 11 minutes of their reservation along with a complimentary glass of champagne. 

Finally, you seem to be under the impression that the restaurant seated them late by first having them sit in the tea garden and then moving them to the main dining room at 7:56, but the tea garden portion is a standard part of their menu per their Resy page: ""Your evening will begin in our serene tea garden before inviting you to join us at our chef's counter."" | their reservation was for 7:30, and they were served their first course at 7:41. so, not sure what you read to conclude they waited 50 minutes. reading comprehension skills might need a little work. also, simply watching the recording and noting the time stamp for when each thing occurred isn't ""time-stamping every customer"". I would hardly be hangry if I was served 11 minutes into my dining experience. | It's ok, u owned them hard lol | I love Tonchin, and it's definitely not the cheapest bowl of noodles that you can get in the city, but I have no clue how you got to $95 for two bowls of ramen unless you're not mentioning drinks or appetizers alongside it? I'm pretty sure their ramen is \~$20 a bowl or so | Woo. Thank you! | Tonchin tonkatsu is the shit. | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | [removed] | This was a number of years ago, but from memory I might've had a beer, think my partner had tap water. No appetizers. We live in London which isn't exactly a low CoL area, but our eyes were watering.

NYC Focaccia Recommendations,"I'm making my first visit to NYC. Would anybody be able to recommend a place that has a good Focaccia sandwich or even just good Focaccia bread? I'm specifically looking for something in Lower/Upper East/West Village. I live in Vegas, and the water here is terrible for fresh-made breads, but I've always heard the reason NYC has good pizza and bagels is because of the water. ","Radio Bakery’s foccacia sandwiches are pretty popular

I also like the sandwiches at Cerasella in LIC | Check out Sullivan street bakery. Bread heaven | I like focaccia from Eataly | https://www.allanticovinaiousa.com | Via Della Scrofa in the East Village for focaccia sandwiches | Rosemary’s | Bread story | Lilia | The Patisserie in the tin building at south street seaport has a pretty good one imo.

Amazing bread and sandwiches. | Foca Foca in Park Slope in pretty great | Lost bread at union square farmers market makes incredible focaccia | Go to Courst St in Brooklyn and visit Caputo's bakery. Focaccia is amazing. It's been in busy over 100 years. 

And Carroll Gardens neighborhood is a great place to visit. | Skip the Focaccia, and go to All'Antico Vinaio and get the Schiaccitta sandwiches. Some of the best sandwiches I've ever had when I was in Florence, Italy and the one in NYC ain't far off in quality either. 

The mortadella, stracciatella and pistachio sandwich is my favorite sandwich I've ever eaten in my 38 years of existing. | C&B focaccia!! In the East Village | The focaccia at Breads is pretty tasty but I saw is $9.75 a slice now 😏 | Also a really great one is deep brooklyn at L’imprimerie | Make the trip to Jersey City and go to Bread and Salt. Best of the best no competition.

  
Signed, a Manhattanite | The everything focaccia at radio is EFfed up good | What time do you think you need to get there before things are sold out?

I went once at like 2 and they had like 2 things left. | Grease bomb though... | The only place I town I know of where you can get Roman pizza bianca. It's great too. Does anyone know anywhere else? | Naur. | Worth noting their bread is schiaciatta, not focaccia. | Yep, this is it. Not cheap, but delicious! | love it!! Exactly what I was looking for | A restaurant not many know about… but the best focaccia I’ve had in NYC  | Yesssss | The plain tomato sauce focaccia is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Deceptively simple but so good. | Probably closer to 10 or 11am. That's when they bring out the lunch foccacia sandwiches. | Grand Daisy Bakery!!!! Also pretty close to Sullivan St bakery | Exactly… it’s literally a focaccia restaurant 💀 | I haven’t had anything there I haven’t been impressed by, i just have flavorits. The hype is real, but only on a weekday. | LOL why am I being downvoted for liking a slice of bread? LOLOLOL | Thank you!"
Park Slope Recs,Going to a comedy show in Park Slope Saturday. What’s your ideal dinner and drink lineup for a good evening?,"I'm partial to Chela | What vibe and price range are you looking for?

I would do Pecking House + Bar Goto Niban

Or 

Nene’s Taqueria + Finback Brewery | Some favorites - can't go wrong with any of these:

Drinks: Honeycomb, Bar Louise, Blueprint, Sweet Polly, or Bar Goto

Dinner: Haenyeo, Pasta Louise, al di la, Bricolage, Runner Up | Chuzo Culture. Great food and drinks. | $$$: Ishi, Masalawala, Haenyeo

$$: Daigo, Bangkok Degree

$: Nene’s, Brooklyn DOP, 7th Ave Donuts | Runner Up | For drinks, I'd add High Dive, Lo-fi, and The Gate, and Owl Farm to the mix. 

I'd second Hanyeo and Al Di La. For lower prices, Tava is a casual Turkish Mediterranean joint. | Pecking House is incredible. The house (short rib) Pho at the terribly named, but still delicious, 5ive Spice is also good. A walk to Gowanus, but Baba’s Pierogis is also excellent and close to many good breweries | Pasta Louise sadly a shell of its former self. | Went here—this place is amazing | Yess that short rib pho is so good"
Best Turkey Sandwich UWS,"Wife just gave birth, and she’s been craving a turkey sandwich for 9 months while holding off deli meat. Looking for the best turkey sandwich (classic sub, thanksgiving sandwich, etc) near 59th and Tenth. Thanks!","Parm has great turkey sandwich | Mani Market....they bake a turkey every morning. | I'm a fan of Sandwell! Owner seems to really care about the quality of the ingredients + makes a lot of sauces in house. They have a turkey sandwich called ""The Lunchbox Special"" on their menu | I love Friedman's Club Sandwich.  Massive sandwich, hits the spot for me every time. | Milano Market | Lenwich | Came here to say this, if there’s a parm nearby definitely give it a shot. Wasn’t expecting it when I first tried it but very  surprisingly impressed | Think this is it. Thanks! | The funny thing is that it's fresh turkey so they could have had it while pregnant | Not exactly near 59 & 10th, but Mani (Columbus & 94) is great! | Agreed! I also like turkey from Viand on 75th | question about Milano. I constantly see it recommended here and on lists and everywhere. I know there's an UES location and an UWS. The lists always how UES. 

I've had it at the UWS multiple times, and they're fine. Will continue to eat there, but they're definitely not ""top list"" material, in my opinion.

Is the UES location different/better than UWS? Or am I just alone in this one, thinking that Milano just isn't that great? | You’re getting downvoted but I had a family member who, after a long illness, had a very specific turkey hero craving (cold cut turkey, not the fresh stuff) and we tried deli after deli and no one was getting it right. On a whim we tried a custom Lenwich and it scratched the itch better than they imagined; sometimes, it’s what you need. | I’m pregnant and delivering at the same hospital as you, and this is my plan! I hope she loved it! | I dont think they are related. Ive been to both and their menus seem completely different to me. | Lenwich makes a great sandwich. It's a local chain but it's good. | She did! Good luck! | There are identical sandwiches on both menus (different names). There was a thread a while back on the Caesar wraps where this was discussed a bit, and someone jokingly started /r/MilanoFeuds lol | A Jimmy T is never a bad call imo! | Hmm. Maybe there is some overlap. One of the sandwiches I get is actually on both menus now that I look more closely. The other sandwich I get is only on the UWS menu though. | Oh I’m sure, the menu isn’t completely the same but the similarities in the specialty sandwiches definitely points to some previous relationship, I think | Probably some family feud, maybe siblings who havent spoken to each other in 30 years after the death of their parents and who wanted to leave their sandwich empire to the older one, but the younger one wanted to be next in line and broke out on their own after a failed assassination attempt with a poisoned pickle. | 10/10 would watch this biopic"
Special New Years Food ideas?,"I know it's early but a few places I've ordered osechi from in the past have already started taking orders. 

I was tempted to order it again (mostly for datemaki which is hard to find outside of New Years) but I was wondering if there were other cultures of just unique foods you really only eat at New Years that I'd be able to pick up.","I love osechi! Just curious which places you've been to in the past.

And I've done New Year's cooking challenges for myself in the past, but I feel like foods I remember reading up on you can mostly make at home? Things like hoppin' johns, collard greens, cornbread, lentils, grapes, fruit, etc etc etc

You could look out for nian gao in Chinese bakeries. They do sell it at Lady Wong, too! You could go out for \[toshikoshi\] soba. You might have already had ozoni with the osechi meals you've had. | Lechon (suckling pig) is amazing if you have a larger group | Soba | I've had these the past 3 years:

1. Odo - $350 + optional $100 chirashi box this year (taking orders already)

2. Mogmog - $300 this year (also taking orders laready)

3. Sunrise Mart - $75 last year 

I understand there's a ton of stuff to have for New Years that I could do at home but this has ended up being my christmas gift to myself just because it's generally not a cheap/easy thing to have prepared | I've had Lechon from a few popups and it is amazing. I didn't realize it was more of a New Years food! | Thanks for that list! Also, if you haven't had it, Okonomi does an in-person osechi. I also think that I've read about Hakubai doing it in previous years, but I think they stopped for a few years after the pandemic.   
  
Oh, I wasn't suggesting that you had to make food at home. I meant that when I was researching it before for myself, most of the foods I came across that are auspicious or that people eat in other countries seemed to be way less complicated and less fancy than osechi, like more home cooking type food. | How were they? I was thinking of getting an osechi box this year. | A classic Filipino suckling pig (as in whole or half animal) prepared with sides, all on banana leaves, definitely a celebration meal"
Salteñas in the Bronx?,"Can anyone recommend a good place for Salteñas in the Bronx? It would be super-great if it was somewhat close to the New York Botanical Garden, but I’m open to any suggestions. Thank you!","Following because I’m interested, but the only saltenas we’ve ever been able to track down were in Queens (at Bolivian Llama Party, which has excellent saltenas). | There's a guy that sometimes does Peruvian pop ups in Brooklyn (most often in Park Slope), and he usually does ceviche, but at one of his last ones, he did saltenas. If you weren't also looking for something Bronx-specific, he usually posts in r/Brooklyn | BLP rocks. Just wish they had warmer seating for the cold months. | Hoping my fellow Redditors “know a place”. :)"
Food suggestions for December,"My boyfriend and I are staying on W 35th in December. He's never stayed in NYC and he wants to go to Rockefeller Center(sooo touristy, I know). He is a BIG foodie. He's big on steak, tuna and anything Asian(and American, for that matter). We've heard Double Chicken, Please is the place to go but I'm looking for a little less of a tourist trap. We are from Boston, so we know how the city life can be. Any suggestions? :)","You don’t mention budget so I’m going to try to give a range here. If he loves steak take him to Keen’s. It’s right near where you are staying. He loves Asian food - go to Korea town for Kbbq (you can search the sub for suggestions tons of options). Sushi - grab and go at sushi 35 west or if you want to do omakase there are a million options of all different price ranges (again can search the sub). Depending on how much time you have venture to either Chinatown or flushing. Double chicken please is a good option. I bet he would love sip and guzzle too. Will need reservations for those. If you give more specific info on how long you are visiting, what your budget is etc that would help people give better recommendations. | I love Double Chicken and think its pretty unique but I probably wouldn't go unless if I can snag reservations because there's a huge line at opening. They release reservations like 6 or 7 days ahead of time at midnight on RESY. You have to get them the second midnight strikes or else it's gone.

\---

**Koreatown:**

Depending on how west you are but 35th st. is around Koreatown area and there's tons of good Korean food there. Some Winter time recommendations:

[Hakata Ton Ton](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tKrTgAzMUEVoTDJ57) always get my recommendation for Japanese hotpot. Their smallest hot pot serves 2. In my experience, you don't need reservations but they are easy to get. IMO they're the best hot pot in the city.

[Cho Dang Gol](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WM8cRo6F4qQ6Ydxa8) is down the block from Hakata Ton Ton and does really good Korean Tofu stew, but there is always a long line at opening. They do not do reservations so might be iffy unless if you want to wait.

[Tonchin ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TXVsKET7Z2md2Wf67)has pretty good ramen, you should definitively get reservations but they're pretty easy to get as long as you get them in advance (aka not last minute).

If you want something grab and go for lunch/snack, [E-mo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KfFAagwTyzTW7aEB6) is my favorite hole in the wall for Korean gimbaps.

**Dessert/Sweets:**

IMO Koreantown doesn't have that many spots for desserts but I would hit up the street where Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tart is. There's like 3 dessert spots all right next door from each other so you'll probably find something you like. 

There's [Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tart](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zj7BSM18vZ84cZwP8) where they sell Japanese cheese tarts with different flavors. [Sundae's Best](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XvzyiaiH54sBbjfP7) does Korean inspired Gelato, [Kiki Modern Cake](https://maps.app.goo.gl/umBQihGL3xf9kvgt6)s does bouncy Japanese Cheese cakes/cream puffs.

[Xing Fu Tang](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hcCW4XP4uLiGRxnA6) opened a location at 34th street. They are a chain from Taiwan, but they have the best boba in town. It's made fresh in a giant wok by the counter and it's chewy and delicious. 

There's also [Grace Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7ei8HtBgZCojmcXV6) which is known for their basque cheesecake. They might be the best dessert spot in the area but I've never been because it's always packed whenever I walk by and I hate waiting in lines lol. | What kind of Asian food is he looking for? Korean, Japanese, Malaysian, Filipino, Indian etc? And within that, what kind of dishes? For example, if it’s Korean do you want BBQ, noodles, soups, or fine dining, etc? Any preferred neighborhoods and vibes?

-	Golden Diner (American diner with Asian influences)

-	Ariari
-	Angel
-	Shuya
-	Hyderabadi Zaiqa
-	Spicy Village
-	Okdongsik
-	Taste Good
-	Gai Kitchen | You're right by Koreatown (I like Han Bat on 35th, Cho Dang Gol on 32nd, Jongro on 32nd for KBBQ, and bb.q on 32nd for fried chicken) and Keen's on 35th (my favorite steakhouse in the city, known for their mutton chop, also great to have lunch at their bar) | Keens steakhouse on W 35 or 36. Known for their mutton chops. | I think le grand bucherie is so beautiful for the holidays and amazing seafood. It’s French | We’re only staying for the night. We have no budget. These look great!! Thanks so much for the input! | My pleasure. With just the night you might want to stick close to your location. So I’d say check out pebble bar for drinks, go see the tree and the decorations along 5th ave, sushi lunch, and steak or kbbq dinner. | It’s like you know me! Lol. Thanks again"
5 days in nyc,"Hey team, going to nyc for 5 days in a few weeks and trying to book all my dinners. So far I’ve got Crown Shy, Four Horsemen, Red Hook Tavern and Shukette. Any suggestions for one more dinner? Or for lunches? What am I missing? :)","We can't tell you what you're missing until you tell us what you're looking for... There's plenty of generic NYC 'must try' lists out there (good ones too) that you can take a look at. My most memorable meal this year has been at Tatiana, for example. 

People here tend to be a lot more helpful if you pose specifics (dish, cuisine, view, vibe). Tell us what you want and we'll try to help you find it! You have some good spots on your list (minus maybe Crown Shy - I didn't see what the fuss was about). | If you can make it to Ki sushi in Brooklyn, it's amazing. | - One White Street
- Le Veau d’Or
- YingTao
- Emmett’s on Grove
- Trattoria L’Incontro

Bonus one: go visit a little neighborhood spot and sit at the bar, just over the river in Brooklyn Heights. Inga’s Bar. Get some small plates and pretend you live in the neighborhood for a second. | Italian? Asian? | Skip crown shy, not worth it | Crown why? We had the worst meal there! I have no idea what the fuss is about and yet people rave. | Good to know about Crown Shy - I’ll reconsider. Trying to diversify the cuisines, and forgot to add that I’ve got Potluck Club for lunch one of the days, so that adds some Chinese cuisine into the mix. I’m going to try and walk-in at Don Angie or Via Carota (too late to snag a reservation), but if there are other Italian places you’d say are a must-try (would be an early din pre-theatre) then would love to hear em! | +1 for one white street | I’ve got Potluck Club for lunch one day (covering Asian), but if you have any other must try Asian spots, I’d love to hear em! All types of Asian cuisines would be great, except for Thai (due to some allergies unfortunately). In terms of Italian, it’s too late for me to get reservations where I’m hoping to go (Don Angie, Via Carota) so I may have to attempt a walk in. | Exactly. I went a few years ago and could not for the life of me understand the hype. It's also got the ambiance of...and office building. | Exact same for me, one of the worst meals I've had in nyc. | Seems like everyone’s got a lot of thoughts on Crown Shy haha. Have any of you tried Estela? Would you recommend that over Crown Shy? | I would try to have some Resy notifications setup for lunch at Torrisi. Even if you don't get a resy, you can always sit at the bar. I did this recently and had a fantastic meal. Some people have also mentioned showing up at 5/530 which might be better for a pre-theatre dinner.

I love Don Angie's but getting in has just been a pain lately. And the last time I went a few months ago, it wasn't as good as it used to be (still great) but that's just one person's opinion. 

Potluck Club is fun - but it is American Chinese. Nothing wrong with that at all but if you're looking for more something more authentic I'd also recommend taking a look at Mountain House for Szechuan or Uncle Lou's for Canto. I'm not an expert in this cuisine but there are loads of good options. | This is super helpful. Thanks so much!"
Looking for a bialy in UWS,We're coming in for the weekend from Baltimore and my Jewish father insists on us bringing home some bialys.

Din Tai Fung reservations,"I’m coming to the city Friday November 29th and leaving Saturday the 30th. All I want is to eat at Din Tai Fung but reservations are all booked up for those days. Does anyone have experience with what time reservations could be released/ when to check? I’ll literally check the website everyday. 

I also saw that their midtown location is reservation only…  do they still take walk ins and put you on a waitlist? Thank you. This is very important to me. ","Keep checking on Nov 29/30 for last min cancellations - might have to get lucky and hope something opens up | If DTF doesn’t work out, you could try Pinch Chinese in the W Village - it was opened by a former DTF chef. | Not worth the hype. | Din tai fung in ny is sooo not worth it. There’s way better elsewhere here. | They release reservations 30 days before. They do not take walk ins | That place is McDonald’s of soup dumpling.

Their main dish - soup dumpling is as bad as frozen ones. | There is much better dim sum in the city. | They don’t take walk-ins but I just had this issue last week. The reservations open up about 24-48 hrs before your desired time. Check around 9 am EST the day before. | Golden Unicorn & Jin Fung in China Town to me are better and are far less expencive | If you just want soup dumplings without the gimmick then there's plenty of other places in NY.  Go to DTF when you take a trip to Taiwan, it's not worth the effort you are going through. | My friend and I walked in right before 2 pm past Friday,  went on Yelps website there and made a reservation for the same time without any problem. People were doing that left and right. I don't know what time you have in mind but try the off hour. | They post bar seats a week before so if you’re going with a small party try a week from your res date! | Maybe also consider Joe Shanghai? | I’ve been to DTF all over the world including the OG in Taipei and the best XLB I’ve had in recent memory was at CheLi. DTF in the rest of the world is a food court meal. | My bf and I were able to snag a same day reservation day of just by checking their reservation website and refreshing! Maybe just check when you’re already here! Times will pop up! | Check around 3pm, which is when they typically do their day-of reservation drops in the system. | This place is not good! Please don’t waste your time…. Hard soupless dumplings. | You're guaranteed to find a spot every day at midnight Eastern time. | The consensus unfortunately seems to be the NY location is very inconsistent. So it's probably not worth it the effort to try to go. I did go in LA and it was very good. But I'd probably go somewhere else in NY. | Skip it | Start checking for their BAR counter reservations a week prior - those get released later (about 7-8 days before but it’s a little inconsistent). On Yelp, the bar counter resys are a diff page than the regular dining room reservations so just fyi make sure you are looking at the right one. If you are fairly timely in checking you should be able to snag something! | Cabbage and Shrimp Fried Rice where my two favorite dishes there. | I went this past weekend. Check online those days for last-minute cancellations which does happen. I was able to get one at 3:30PM but showed up earlier at 12:30PM and asked them if they could accommodate me earlier and they did (we were also an easy party of 2). | Hoping that is the case but I did just discover Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao which seems pretty much identical to DTF. That’s my backup option | Just keep checking every day for cancellations.  We were able to score a reservation this way. | I remember getting downvoted to hell for saying this place is terrible before grand opening 

I don’t trust the tastebud of this subreddit | The best thing I’ve ever had at a DTF (and I have been to 6 of them in the US) is their stir fried bok choy. I may be biased as a half Chinese girl who’s had great soup dumplings her whole life, but DTF is very overrated. | This! I’ve been twice by getting reservations on the morning before I want to go. | I went in LA as well and that’s where I fell in love with it. I hate to hear this new restaurant has been inconsistent so far and this is my birthday dinner so I’d rather not have to sit there for 3 hours waiting for food/ being disappointed with what we get :/ | Nan Xiang is better for XLB imho

For DTF keep on checking for last min cancels

I think they might also started taking walkins, call and ask | Having been to both places, I prefer Nan Xiang XLB.  Don't know if it's because DTF is new and they're just going through some growing pains.  I've been to DTF in Taiwan and it tastes different.  Don't know if it's because they Americanized the ingredients or what have you.  I like DTF in Taiwan. | It’s solid and excellent choice without the frills. | DTF is much nicer the Nan Xiang. I like some things at Nan Xiang but their dumplings are not great. | Hah I went with a big group and the favorite dish by far was the green beans. | I agree. That said their green beans and chili oil wontons are god tier. Funny enough my friends all joke that DTF is good at everything besides their XLB. They are not bad but they’re so expensive and Nan Xiang are quite good. | I was not impressed by the dumplings or the noodles at Nan Xiang but some of their other stuff was great (rice cakes, fried rice, sticky rice roll, tofu soup)"

East/West Village Coffee Shop Recommendations ,Making my first visit to NYC. I would greatly appreciate some coffee shop recommendations . ,"Any preference on type of coffee, vibes, and pastries? Some general recs:

- Ninth St Espresso
- Everyman Espresso
- The Elk
- Oslo Coffee Roasters
- Joe Coffee Roasters
- Do Not Feed Alligators | In terms of people watching in the West Vill- I love Cafe Kitsune | La Cabra and MUD are cool but you should really try Porto Rico’s EV location if you get the chance. $4 for a quad shot americano. PR is one of the best in Manhattan | Abraco in East village has the best coffee. Latte or piccolo is my favorite.  Great vibes too | The Elk! | which one of these would you recommend for  a good espresso? | I used to go to their hole in the wall back in 2013. And one day I returned to discover they weren't there anymore and grief overtook me. So I asked a neighboring business what happened and they directed me across the street to their new location. I love abraco. But I feel, maybe, when they were a hole in the wall, the energy was different. | What do you like in espresso eg roast level and tasting profile?

I’m partial to lighter roasts that are full bodied and with fruit-forward notes. For that, I would go for La Cabra. You can check the shop menus to see if it fits your preferences. | There are definitely days when you walk in there and it is absolutely mobbed. Like 30+ people in there and 10 in line

Other days though, it’s empty, you can hear the vinyl playing, it’s just like old times"
Dessert tasting menu/omakase?,"I saw the old post from about an year ago but that seems to be a bit outdated (chickalicious closed, patisserie fouet doesn't seem to be offering anymore) and the options still available are kinda expensive now (ex momoya Soho for $95 is outta budget).

best wings nyc,looking for the best wings - i prefer smaller wings as in my opinion they usually taste better. feel like the super big wings come from chickens pumped up w hormones which make them not as good,"Love the wings at Blondies on the UWS | Plug Uglies on the UES - get the Kerry’s Way wings. It’s the descendant of the old Bar Coastal | > feel like the super big wings come from chickens pumped up w hormones

It is illegal to have added hormones in chickens raised in the US, or sold in the US.

Older chickens just tend to have larger wings, and breasts, increasing yield per bird.

Personally, I don't like larger wings since they take longer to cook. | Wingbar Brooklyn | Big fan of the wings at East End Bar on the UES | The lack of flavor of American chicken is mostly from diet and rearing conditions, not hormones | Can’t believe no one has said Dan & John’s! By far my favorite 🔥 | Really enjoyed Bonnie’s Grill in Park Slope | Chickens raised in the United States are never given hormones, FYI. They were banned by the USDA 70 years ago. They’re just bred to be Frankenstein massive. | Charles’ Pan Fried’s wings are really tasty and surprisingly cheap. | District Tap House. Nobody talks about their wings but they’re perfectly crispy with a lot of sauce and delicious | - Mad for Chicken
- Turntable Chicken
- International Wings Factory
- Rokstar Chicken | Have yet to find a better Korean Fried Chicken spot than UFC for price and quality. | B’artusi has really amazing wings | Fish cheeks have good wings | The wings at Speedy Romeos are like gourmet | Abe’s Pagoda Bar in Bushwick | Double Windsor in park slope | George Keeley UWS better than Blondies | i have not found a wing better than mekelburg’s | Mudville 9 on Chambers Street has been my fav forever. | Marys on Orchard St. in LES. | Queens Bully, the butter chicken wings are my favorite. | Koko wings | Moono for Korean Style, John Doe for dive bar wings | Teddy's in Williamsburg | OTB in Williamsburg | Old Town Bar in Flat Iron | Wildcard choice: Five Spice in Park Slope has really tasty Vietnamese style fried chicken wings! | My favorite wings have always been Dinosaur BBQs K-Pow. Expensive but delicious. Blondies is also always a good go to too, consistently delicious since my early 20s and Im 33 now | I remember really enjoying the wings at Chick Chick on the UWS | Kettle Black in Bay Ridge Brooklyn | Has anyone been to Wangs in Park Slope? | Have you heard of Wingstop? /s 

I stopped buying wings from restaurants they have gotten way too expensive and I make em better at home than most places. | LOVE the Buffalo wings from OTB. Great drinks and fries too! | I just found out my girlfriend loves wings while at a bar for the World Series. It just never came up, I like this. | Wing night at Queens Bully. I like the old bay dry wings and the butter chicken saucy wings. | checkers

also by small wings vs large do you mean the flats and drumettes vs the actual leg and wing? | Upvoting this bc Blondies rules

BUT

Fuck I miss Firehouse so much. Those wings ruled | RIP Bar Coastal. Do they have porkers there too? | It's illegal but does that mean anything? 

1) the election just proved people don't care about illegalities 

2) Europe has much higher standards as regard food production. How does it make sense that an American company, selling the same product, can sell an inferior one in USA because Europe won't allow that nonsense 

3) I've actually recently started seeing Perdue chicken ads on TV claiming their competitors are add hormones and now Perdue is staying committed to not doing so. So is what you are saying even applicable anymore? | Oh man used to love that spot back when I lived there over a decade ago, great batch of flavors too so u could mix it up - haven’t been in forever | Best winds easily. Massive and many excellent sauces & dry rubs | East end closed recently big sad | Mine as well! | Park slope has some awesome wings. Bonnie’s, Union Hall, Wang’s all excellent. | I really enjoy these wings as well! | Makes sense, the dude is actually from Buffalo in the first place and these, in my admittedly limited amount of searching, are the closest to good wings in Buffalo | Bonnie's is expensive. | UFC are fricking good  
You should try Mad for Chicken | It IS so expensive now. Do you have a recipe you like? | Fascinating. | Pertaining those ads, 
the claim ""no hormones added"" cannot be used on the labels of pork or poultry unless it is followed by a statement that says ""Federal regulations prohibit the use of hormones.""  
That's the fine print on the ad. | 1. No company is going to want to undergo costly litigation for this. Imagine if they get caught using it and they supplied a major food provider like, US Foods. The damages could be immense. Not sure what your statement about elections has anything to do with compliance with food safety laws. 

2. I think the key things to keep in mind is that in EU the regulatory scheme generally requires producers to prove something is safe vs. the US, which is more reactive (e.g., once proven harmful). With that said, the U.S. does a bit better of a job with food labeling IMO. The difference in regulatory scheme is ultimately a bit philosophical, with the US scheme predictably favoring commerce over regulation. 

3. I guess I can see them making an ad like that if they don’t specify who “competitors” are. Food producers in the US frequently just regurgitate stuff like “GH Free” when it’s the regulatory requirement, but the thing is, the public often doesn’t know that. What they are basically saying is, “we are committing to the bare minimum regulatory requirement mandated to us by the federal government.” But that doesn’t sound as nice on TV does it? | Wait that's west end bar and grill lmao | Dram Shop and Double Windsor too. | I just wing it...pun intended. I usually sprinkle them with a little adobo and toss them in a classic buffalo sauce made from Tabasco or red hot and a little butter.

 It's mostly about the quality of the wings I usually get at a restaurant. They tend to be more fatty/ sinewy because they want to serve giant old bird wings."
Small grilled Japanese mackerel?,"Theres a dish i had in Japan that was a small (5-6”), skinny (2”), grilled mackerel(?) in like sweet glaze….anyone know the name or where i can get this?",Saba shioyaki. Izakaya Noname in LIC has it with the sweet soy glaze | I believe you're thinking of sanma (mackerel pike). They tend to be thinner than other mackerel (saba) and their face comes to a narrow point. Taste is fairly similar between the two. | Did you have it at an izakaya in Japan? There are izakayas here that have it too like at [Izakaya Mew](http://mewnyc.com/menu) and [Izakaya Fuku](https://www.orderfukunyc.com/). | Thanks!
Give me your must-try Manhattan restaurants,"I’ve been to nyc a bunch of times, but haven’t been in a few years and would like to try some new great spots with my wife next week. 
Our taste:
- want to avoid overrated places for tourists 
- money is not an issue, but we don’t like stuffy, fine dining vibes, unless the food is spectacular. 
- we love Japanese, Korean, Mediterranean food the most, but we live in Vancouver, where there’s excellent Asian restaurants, so would prefer to try other things (Peruvian, middle eastern, etc).  That said, any excellent Asian places would be great to have. 
- We’re staying in the upper east side, but anywhere in Manhattan would do. 

Thank you!","Le Coucou, Casa Mono, Minetta Tavern"

"A big THANK YOU to this sub, we ate really well :) ","My husband and I had our best vacation trip in your lovely city for 2 full weeks. It was my first time visiting NYC from Singapore so I was looking forward to trying out all the food in the city.

Here's the list of places that my husband and I went to:

* Brooklyn bagel
* Los Mariscos
* Magnolia bakery for banana pudding and key lime cheesecake
* Almondine bakery for croissant
* Xi’an fine foods - so good we had it thrice
* Shu Jiao Fu Zhou

* Levain bakery - dark chocolate chocolate chip cookie
* Papaya King
* Ariana Afghan kebab
* Halal Guys
* K-JUN (our friend made a reservation - recommend to do so cause the space is small)
* Grey’s Papaya
* Raku
* Haymaker bar and kitchen (a friend's pick)
* L’industrie

* Yankee Clipper Dinner (Beacon)
* Glazed over donuts (Beacon)
* Katz’s Delicatessen

* Ivan Ramen (another friend’s pick haha)
* La chilaqueria
* Saperavi",
where to go on day off,"if you had a day off work and time to kill, what are some food spots you’d go to? 

","In theory, it would be lunch at Le Bernardin, a few drinks at the Plaza ahead of reading in the Park for a while before a couple more drinks at Bemelmans and then dinner at Sushi Jin. In practice, it would probably be Spring Lounge around 8-9 AM and then an uber over to Rudy's for hot dogs once I'm hungry around 2, then back to the apartment to pass out. | Places that are hard to get to by public transportation and places I want to enjoy without my children. Examples: Le Crocodile, Panorama Room, Red Hook Tavern, a quiet afternoon eating a Parisi’s sub in the Elizabeth Street Garden.

Edit to add: Anywhere on Staten Island. | 7 train food crawl (Bolivian Llama Party, Nepali Bhancha Gar, Fuskahouse, etc) 

or Flushing food crawl (Yukun Shaobing, New World Mall, Parksanbal, etc) | Jackson heights! | Chinatown in Flushing. So many different things to eat for relatively little money. | Last time I went to Golden Diner. Good, but prefer Bubby’s.

Was thinking about Red Hook Tavern next. | Santa Fe BK | I spontaneously went to Via Carota on a weekday recently around 1:30pm and had a really nice afternoon. Waited only about 15 minutes for a table. | JG Melons | i havent had shake shack in a minute | Elbow bakery | You still have to use your own money on your day off 😭 | Did we just become best friends? | How do you access the Elizabeth Street Garden? Always thought it wasn’t open to public but maybe it’s bc i only walk by after 6 when im leaving work?? If it’s indeed open to public during day, sounds like I know where me & my parisi sub are chillin on my next PTO day! Great reco - thank you! | fascinating. i wouldnt even put golden diner and bubbys in the same category unless you are comparing pancakes to pancakes. | Just walk in! One side is on Mott Street and always closed. The other end, on Elizabeth, is open 11am-6pm. Make sure you go soon, they’re going through a long eviction process with the city. | Yeah, it was for pancakes. Went a couple weeks apart."
best sushi near bryant park?,not omakase pls looking for fairly priced really good sushi and a nice vibe is good but food comes first. thanks in advance! ,"Wokuni (39 and Lex) often has a salaryman crowd, and the quality is fantastic. | If you don't mind taking out (maybe walking over to the park to eat?), Sushi 35 West is about the best quality to price ratio you can find. The sushi chefs used to work at Masa. The quality of the food is incredibly high, but they cut costs but serving it out of a literal hole in the wall lol.

It's about a 10 min walk from Bryant Park | Yasuda | Hatsuhana is around 48th and fits the bill | Sho | I’ve gotten takeout from Joji which has been good. | Yasuda. Hatsuhana is also good | Koi at The Bryant Park Hotel. | sushi of gari 46 | Joji | It’s korean but mari ne handroll bar is great | Marine hand rolls! | Sushi Lab | Second this. get the chirashi bowl for lunch | maybe the best sushi I've had in NYC | Want to try this place so bad and see the reviews are pretty good but for some reason I’m put off by the name. Is that dumb? Should I go? | Agree it’s a stupid name. The same people operate Chemistry Room downstairs which I really enjoyed - it’s a more interactive/friendly omakase than most. Sushi Lab upstairs is a more dialed-down/a-la-carte version. I wouldn’t consider them a destination, but if you need to be in that area, it’s a solid option. | Yeah I’m always in midtown unfortunately lol so might consider. Thanks for the advice :)"

What's Your Ideal Restaurant Seat?,"NYC foodies, quick question: Where do you really want to sit when you go out to eat? Are you into the basements/upstairs or do you prefer street-level seating?

Do you hate sitting upstairs, or does it depend on the place? And do you have a seating preference listed in your Resy profile?

NYC restaurants tend to have interesting layouts due to size/location , so what are some spots you recommend for each type of seating—upstairs, downstairs, or street level? And are there any places you'd avoid sitting in certain spots?

Curious to hear your thoughts!","Outside during a nice day. Inside cozy booth at night. | Generally speaking I hate being seated right by a door of some kind, I know that’s tough sometimes, but I want to feel like I’m in the actual restaurant not in the way, or out on the sidewalk. | If I’m by myself, usually at the bar. People are usually more down to chat and it’s a lot more exciting to look around at the bar than to eat in the corner where lots of spots place solo diners lol.

If I’m on a date, I prefer a corner booth or somewhere that I can sit next to the person and chat more easily.

If I’m with friends, it doesn’t usually matter too much unless the table is near the bathroom. That kinda kills the vibe | At the bar | The corner seat with every table view | A corner booth | Booth. Nothing else comes close. | I don't want to deal with stairs. | Chefs table or bar seating. | In a chair or booth | Bar seats, at a 90 degree corner, where we can easily face each other | No outdoor. | In a booth if they have them, or other wise at a table at the side or in a corner. I don’t like being in a table in the middle - feels too exposed and busy with people walking around me all the time. | Love booths and banquettes.

Yesterday my friends and I were sat downstairs at the UWS P.J. Clarke’s, where the jazz bar used to be (full service bar still exists), in a corner banquette and it was great. | Avoid upstairs in a pizza place during summer. All the oven heat rises. | Good question. 

First date: get a nice quiet or medium volume level table apart from each other. Like a gentleperson.

Established relationship: u go for bar seating always u already know what each other look like naked. Plus u can hear each other better. 

Group: always corner wrap around leather seat seating. This is the comfiest and u get a view of the restaurant action. | Never outside near the bums, smokers, bus fumes.  Those are the worst seats.

Never by the kitchen or restrooms or the front door.

Always avoid those seats which are bad.

I prefer booths over tables when available.

I hate going up a flight of stairs, prefer first floor. | Whenever I request a certain table type in my reservation notes, it seems generally ignored, even if that table type is available and I’m able to switch at the restaurant. 
I wonder if staff even sees/reads the requests. | B1 | As an often solo eater this is the move. I don't feel bad for making somebody wait on me. Quicker service. I can talk or not depending on my mood. It just checks all the boxes. Even when I'm with somebody, unless it's an intimate date, it's a no brainer. | Curious why you like the bar best.  | This.  And at the chef’s table if one exists | I've started to feel like if you're going to go pay a bunch of money for a restaurant, it makes it a lot more worth it if you can watch them prepare the food. It'd be nice to have a list of places with good chef's counter experiences | It's pleasant when you are alone. | What is a chef's table? | Basically, ALOT of open kitchens have a bar setup directly looking into the kitchen so you can watch the kitchen team cooking.  You are basically served directly out of the kitchen. 

Lartusi has  one, I’ll Buco used to have a table setup in their kitchen, Hearth restaurant, Frank Restaurant | Ah I see. Totally know what you're referring to! 

Would eating at a McDonald's with the kitchen in view be considered a chef's table too? /s | That would be my preferred seat.  Still can’t beat the fries… | Do you remember the 80's when they were still using beef tallow? My oh my. Salivating. | The good old days"
Thanksgiving Sides Preorder,"I’m going to a Friendsgiving on the 17th, and cooking in my apartment is a disaster waiting to happen. Looking for places to order sides that just need reheating. I’ve already checked Whole Foods, Wegmans, Rigor Hill, and Hometown BBQ. It needs to be available for pre-order before Thanksgiving day.

Much appreciated! ","Try Butterfield Market on the UES | Fresh Direct | Citarellas does them too, and I saw Court St Grocers is as well | my family gets most of our thanksgiving sides from eli zabar’s. they come with instructions and everything to just reheat in the oven. orders from their thanksgiving menu are definitely available at least somewhat earlier than the actual holiday. | If you’re on the Upper West Side, Citarella’s or Zabar’s. Not sure if they’re open Thanksgiving, but you can pick up whatever looks good late Wednesday. Fair warning: it’ll be a madhouse."
"Friday night walk in, where should I go? ","In the city for work Friday and Saturday. Need a place to walk in Friday. Cool to sit at bar. Would love a rec for a place you enjoy yourself- something quieter, good cocktails, looking for a burger or a steak.  

Any cuisine open- thank you! ","Almost any steak house. I love Smith and Wollensky Grill but on Friday and Saturday night, not quiet. | Raoul’s (go early for burger or steak au poivre anytime). Lure (seafood-centric love but great burger, great bar scene). Hawksmoor. Union Square Café. Pastis. | Also recommend Gramercy Tavern, Frenchette, Le Rock, also Minetta Tavern for a great burger too. | Minetta Tavern, Peter Luger’s, Keen’s, (or really any steakhouse with a bar), Rolo’s, Red Hook Tavern.

For something a little different: Nowon, Le B, Raoul’s

Babbo over the years has consistently made one of the better non-steakhouse steaks. Though currently it’s a 32 oz porterhouse so you’d have your work cut out for you. 

In a similar vein, the Short Rib at Il Buco Alimentari is a big, beefy marvel. But bring your Lipitor if you plan on eating it solo. | Thank you | I was thinking minetta or red hook. I have a 10pm res at death and co, so maybe minetta bar. Thanks! | Going from RHT to D&C would be a pain in the ass, so yeah, you’d want to center things closer."
Speakeasy/Christmas feel restaurants near Radio City,"Hey guys,

So my girlfriend and I (both 20) are traveling to NYC in a few weeks to go see the rockettes at Radio City and was just curious if anyone knew of restaurants in the area (15-20 min walk) which had a somewhat speakeasy and/or even a Christmas-y feel to grab food before the show.

Whe,Where can I find a steakhouse that serves a Tomahawk streak that won't bankrupt me and I can just walk into without reservations located in Manhattan.,"lol. | Isn’t a bone in ribeye the same thing. It’s probably even better as the chef doesn’t have a giant bone to worry about. | West Side Steakhouse in Hell's Kitchen | Costco has a great deal on this | Fogo, quality meats | I had an axe handle at St. Anselm in Brooklyn a few years ago that was fantastic. It was ~$125 for 2.5 lbs. Everything there is great. | The Stand | Industry Kitchen. Not sure what the price is now but they have 3ft tomahawk for 2 for $80. | Just buy a sous vide. Get a cowboy steak from the butcher. Cook it for 3 hours at 137* and then hard sear it on a grill or pan. It’ll be better and all in all cost you $150 at the most.  | Your mom has a giant bone to worry about | But it's not a Tomahawk and that's what I want!!! | Nice.  Checking it out on Friday | This place has potential 

Calamari was one of the best I've ever had.   I hate paying $17 for Caesar salad but the anchovies were great and we enjoyed splitting the salad.   

I got the cowgirl medium and it was undercooked inside but well done on the outside.   Wife got the lamb shank and was underwhelmed (but I enjoyed it the next day). 

Wife loved her cocktail and glass of wine,  and my beer was reasonably priced. 

Total was $250 for two after tax and tip.  Not bad overall but it's a hole in the wall (I could smell the bathroom cleaning products) | Thank you. | [deleted] | I wish I had the same experience as I’d always heard great things so I tried and the axe they served us was cold for some reason 😐 | It's literally the exact same thing | Insurance job* | Eat your gazpacho, Howie. | It not the same thing. Tomahawks have a huge bone attached to them. 

What about a prime rib? Same thing if you want to talk about where the meat comes from on the cow. | Ok? | Prime rib and ribeye are the same part of the cow but cut for different preparations — slow roast or stew vs grill. Ribeye and tomahawk are identical in cut and preparation and only differ in length of bone and in price"
"Are there any restaurants or shops that sell a one-person cheeseboard, where you get a smaller amount but a larger number of cheeses?","What can I say? Another day, another food craving, baybee.

I don't know if this exists, but my stomach overlord is demanding something that is kind of like a cross between a cheese sampler and a cheese board? Something where you get to nibble on a bunch of different types of cheese, spend less money (relative to variety), and not have to commit to a block if you end up not liking one (even the smallest slivers can seem massive if you do not enjoy). And before someone suggests that stores will open and let you ask to sample a wedge before buying, please let me save my own awkward ass and the innocent cheese counter bystander the excruciating social interaction of me Cold Stone sampling my way through the cheese case.

Bier and Cheese Collective in Astoria has a 5 cheese plate for $12 which I thought was a pretty good value. | This is such a specific restaurant pet peeve of mine - sometimes all I want to do is sit at the bar on a quiet evening and sip high margin wine with a snack, but the best wine snacks on the menu are an insane portion for one person! | [Saxelby Cheesemongers on the lower level of Chelsea Market](https://www.chelseamarket.com/directory-all/saxelby-cheesemongers) has a basket of odd bits of various cheeses  for $2-4 at the register.

I really don’t know why it isn’t more common. | Spitfire has smaller 1-2 person nosh boards that sound similar to what you're describing. | We need a “cheese box bar” like London’s Grape & Fig: https://grapeandfig.com/pages/brityard-pop-up 

Who’s in? | Formaggio Cheese in Essex crossing, I believe they can cater a one person board... Or at least a small size. | Come to Terroir in Tribeca.

Not a restaurant, but a fantastic fun little bar in Chelsea with great drinks and individualised boards for meat and cheese. All of the food is great here! | Wegman’s has these! | The last time I was in Barnyard cheese shop (East Village) I saw they had little sample size bits of cheese pieces for like 2 dollars each, but each piece was large enough to get a few pieces of out them. I don’t go there frequently so I’m not sure if that’s a regular thing they sell, but sounds like something you might be interested in? | Gastronom International Market at 108th street in Queens often has quart-sized boxes of assorted cheese cuts, along with assorted cuts of deli meat in similarly-sized boxes. They do a lot of nice kosher/eastern-European type foods. | The Dutch has a cheese board on their dresser menu and you can choose as little or as much as you want!

They have a cheesemonger on staff too some nights. Not sure about the pricing though. | The vegetarian plate at le relais de Venise l’entrecote is a solid option. 
They’re known for their very tasty steak prix fixe that comes with two servings of steak and fries with sauce, bread and a salad. 

The veggie option is two salads, two orders of fries (with the sauce), a small cheese plate, and any dessert.

I sometimes just want a small app when out on my own, or if I'm out with others, I want an app that no one else is interested in. This makes so much sense. | I wonder if we used to have one. I feel like I walked past a place called ""The Cheese Board"" or something like that in .. maybe the Village or Soho, but it was already shuttered and emptied out inside when I saw it. | I was at Pick & Cheese in Seven Dials Market last month and it was dreamy. Dozens of cheeses and accompaniments from the British Isles, perfectly portioned and on a conveyor belt.

I too am always looking for the best Thanksgiving-style sandwich. I’d say this spot is the best I’ve found in the area. | I got the Parm one last year it was great | Court St Grocers does one after thanksgiving | Not exactly what you’re looking for but the turkey leg sandwich at Henry Public is such a lovely savory bomb of a pub sandwich. Great this time of year. | Comfortland sometimes has one this time of year 

Edit: in case you’re interested, Sweet Afton has Thanksgiving leftovers egg rolls | Mission Sandwich has a turkey and cranberry all year, and the online menu shows a seasonal one with stuffing and gravy right now. | Poulet sans tete on the upper west side and location in the west village has a thanksgiving gobbler sandwich and it is legitimately amazing.

"Birthday, cozy Italian, West Village. Recs please","Hi all,
My wife wants to go to a cozy Italian restaurant in the village for her birthday. This will be early December so I’m hoping to find reservations.

Recommendations please 🙂","Malaparte | San Carlo Osteria Piemonte. Cozy and warm, excellent Piemontese food and a great wine list. Fantastic servers and a memorable experience. One of my very favorite Italian places in all of NYC | Do you mean cozy as in small or aesthetic? 

Olio e Piu is very good and you can get a reservation! It's not a small place though.

Osteria Carlina is a really good cozy Italian spot that you can get a reservation. 

Palma is super cozy and great. Little harder to get a reservation. 

Stay away from the hype places. | Osteria 57 | Canto | Morandi | Cotenna at the bar in the small location | Piccolo Angolo is very cozy, family run and has great Italian. It is very tight seating though. | L’artusi is a larger interior but the decor is quite cozy. Food is excellent. | Piccolo angolo is the coziest, but maybe not fancy enough for a bday dinner.

Don Angie very sought after, you can email them in advance for a reservation

Lartsui is incredible but maybe more glam than cozy if that makes any sense 

I sodi- will be difficult to make a Resy potentially but super easy to walk into, same with via carota | Da Andrea | La Lanterna - old school decor, lasagna flights, and wine list under $70 | Pesce Pasta. Super cozy in an old building. More affordable than most Italian spots in the area. A hidden gem. | i haven’t been in a while but i remember Palma being delicious and very very cute and cozy. | Osteria 57 | Felice on Hudson! | Not exactly west village but: Fiat Cafe, Pepe Rosso | Last time I went, food wasn't as good as I remembered. | The sister restaurant, osteria Carlina is also incredible! | Olio e Piu is a tourist trap!! I would recommend Malaparte | I second Osteria Carlina - really underrated in that part of town | The spot across the street is called aria. Same owners, same menu | Malaparte is very cozy, the food was just ok imo. 

Olio e piu sucks.

Palma is beautiful, my fav part is their back patio though which I’ve never been in in the winter | Also not cozy. It’s very loud & crowded & the food is not very good. il Sodi is good ($$$$$). Anton’s also good. I love Barbuto but it can get loud . | Sure it is, but it still has its merits. That's why I gave 3 recs though | Carlina and San Carlo are both so amazing!! Carlina is my fav Italian spot in town."
Don Angie lunch ,"Hi guys, anyone had luck walking in for Saturday lunch? There are 5 of us and we waited for 9am reservation to open exact to the second and ofc nothing was available. How long in advance should we wait for a walk-in lunch table? Or is it possible at all since it's for a party of 5?

Our other alternative was Torrisi, I've done it myself walking in but it was only for one person so it was easy. Has anyone done it with a party of 4 or 5?","Line usually starts at 30-45min before open and anything over 4 is a little tougher because it limits your table options.  If you’re lucky they might be able to seat you at the first turn, otherwise might have to wait till the 2nd seating.  Good luck and have a lasagna for me! | Not to hijack the thread but curious how early you got to Torrisi before open for the solo lunch? | Thanks, think we are gonna go to Torrisi instead..  | 10min before opening on a Friday | Have eaten at both this year and while DA is awesome.  Torrisi was the best meal of the year.  Truly a great restaurant and specially the service. | Thank you | Thanks! Yeah Torrisi is amazing so at least I know I won't be disappointed."
Best Cantonese BBQ,"What are the best spots? I know Wah Fung is very popular but it seems to also cater to those who value price. I'm looking for more quality. 

Edit: looking for a big takeaway order to host a BBQ party","A Mott St. bbq crawl to Ming Wong, Big Wong, Hay Hay Roasted | Kings Kitchen is really consistent. There’s no best imo. It’s one of those types of foods many places in NY chinatowns do right. Cant go wrong with any of the ones listed here. Just becareful how you order because for the roast pig for example, the best cut is by the ribs and some butchers might give you bad parts with fat/gristle if you don’t specify. | NY Noodletwon. If I’m correct they do the their own ducks and meats on premises as opposed to places that get the duck from a supplier | New Yuewong on Bayard. Better than Hay Hay or the Wongs |  For a big order, I’d go with NY Noodletown or Wus Wonton King. | I like Deluxe Food Market.

More recommendations from a few weeks ago listed by Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens options: [Char siu fan (aka Chinese BBQ pork over rice).](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gd6hwa/char_siu_fan_aka_chinese_bbq_pork_over_rice/) | Yue Wong | E Noodle Cafe on Catherine St. was good. | Xing Wong BBQ and kings kitchen!! Can’t go wrong with any of these places! | My go to is King's Kitchen, Wah Fung is too sweet. | i love many places but i think hay hay may be the best | Which is your fav? | Thanks yes. I'm Cantonese, showing up and telling them exactly what you want in canto makes a huge difference. Especially since I'm planning on a huge order for a party. | looks pretty good | I got the scallion chicken at the deluxe food market a few months back. It was really good. Didn't try any bbq though | Agree. I think Hay Hay roasted is the best. | I like Hay Hay best I think, especially if solo | You could always try a few places before committing to a big order. Whenever this topic comes up, there’s many different recs and it comes down to personal preferences. | Yeah. I was thinking about doing that. My biggest problem with that is inconsistency, most places (even in Hong Kong) are somewhat inconsistent."
Best ramen in Manhattan? Preferably west side or midtown?,Totto Ramen in Hells Kitchen used to do it for me - but has now closed :’(,"Are you looking for any kind of ramen or specifically chicken paitan that Totto specializes in?

In case you’re not aware, there’s a Totto Midtown East.

Midtown:

-	Shuya
-	Tonchin
-	Toribro
-	Totto Ramen (Midtown East)
-	EAK

Others in Manhattan:

-	Ramen Ishida
-	Nakamura
-	Okiboru
-	Yuji Ramen
-	nonono
-	Tabetomo
-	Menkoi Sato
-	Ramen by Ra
-	EAK
-	Ivan Ramen

For chicken paitan broths, see these recs from a few days ago: [Places that can match Ivan Ramen’s Chicken Paitan?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gm72lm/places_that_can_match_ivan_ramens_chicken_paitan/) | Toribro (it’s actually the original Totto chef). | ROKC | Kin Ramen in Midtown | Okiboru house of Tsukemen | Momosans Tan Tan Ramen is my fav. Its really creamy and rich if thats something you’re going for | I've been to almost all of them but Ivan Ramen and Okiboru are definitely the best💯 | Ippudo in Hell’s Kitchen. It’s a few blocks away from totto | Kohoku-ku is pretty good. They have a few different broths. My favorite is the pork broth. Very creamy and rich. Good flavor. Their noodles aren't as good as totto's were though. | Ippudo | I enjoyed Jin Ramen on UWS a lot.

Also second Shuya, their made-in-house noodles are the best in the city. | I enjoy Ichiran (the japanese chain) on 49thst near 7th. | I tried a new place in SoHo called Karakatta and enjoyed it a lot. It’s 230 Thompson Street. For vegan diners, they have a two vegan ramen options. The non-curry vegan ramen has soy milk in the broth to make it creamy | Hide Chan 

Japanese owned and operated. You're welcome. | Isn’t there another midtown west location of totto? I was there a couple months ago | Kame in midtown. Absolutely fantastic! | ROKC is a banger if you wanna make the trip. | Midtown West is Ippudo | Went to Toribro last night was excellent and much better value thab the hyped places | Kame is very good | For tsukemen (dipping ramen) go to Minca by Alphabet city! Cash only but unreal | Tonchin and Ramen Ishida are the only 2 correct answers | Kin Ramen on 56th! | Big fan of Kohoku-Ku | Zen Ramen | Pure thai | Nothing tops Menkoi Sato in the west village. It is insanely good.  | Ivan | Okiburu house of udon and hide Chan. | Marufuku has an excellent chicken broth ramen | That location (near Times Square) is the only one with the separated seating option. The one near Penn Station has the little windows where you only see the waiters hands, but no dividers | teppen ramen | Sad to see it go... [https://w42st.com/post/totto-ramen-closes-hells-kitchen/](https://w42st.com/post/totto-ramen-closes-hells-kitchen/) | Omusubi Gonbei, inside Katagiri Japanese Grocery | my friend & I loooveed Shinjuku Ramen by central park-- I think it's on w 56th street | Is tabetomo open again? | Tonchin | Recently had Jun-men and Tabetomo. Jun-men surprised me as pretty decent given that it had non-traditional stuff. It's more modern ramen, which is hard to pull off, but it does pull this style off. A passing grade.

Tabetomo has tsukemen so I had to try that. Was underwhelmed tbh, was not a fan of the chicken/shoyu-forward flavor profile, but I've been spoiled by Ramen Shack. I bet Tabetomo's tonkotsu is better than their tsukemen though, so I'd return for that. | Mr Taka | Tampopo in Washington Heights | The Westside [Ippudo]() never disappoints | Omg totto closed 😭😭😭😭 | Momosan!  | IMO the best ramen in NYC is at Ramen Ishida on Ludlow street. | Jun-Men Ramen Bar | Ichiran is the only answer. That’s the one. | Lucky cat on 53rd between 2 and 3. It’s not the west side or midtown but it’s the best ramen in the city. | Definitely Ichiran. If I could have Ichiran every week, I woulddd | This is the list, would actually avoid the other recs in this thread | There's also Marufuku, also Hide-Chan next to Totto of course

Also Momosan, Kin Ramen, Kame, Minca | FYI, there is an EAK in Midtown | This is great, thank you | Came here looking to confirm my fav, Ivan. Also the only ramen I've had there. | Thank you so much for this - been craving chicken paitan | Toribro was my go-to spot when I lived in HK. | I gatekeep this spot fr. Love coming here especially when it gets cold | The shorter guy? | And their sister restaurant: NR. | ROKC is a gem | Ramen is top notch… Love the seating here with the private booths | Karakatta rules. Most underrated ramen in town. | Overpriced there’s way better spots out there | The one on W. 52 st (?) has closed... | Apparently same owners as Totto and also closed :( | [Yes](https://www.instagram.com/tabetomonyc?) | Agree this is the list. Ton chin is my fave! | As a former resident of Fukuoka and elsewhere in Kyushu, Hide-Chan always hit the spot for me. | Oh yes, thanks! Will add that in. | No problem. Enjoy! | Yeah, I've tried almost every major spot in the city (including all the spots in the top rated comment), and nothing comes close. | Dunno about height but he always wears a baseball cap and has an eyebrow piercing | right, the booths are totally wacky, as well as not seeing the waiters except their hands.  “so you can focus on the food”.  Best $20 bowl of soup experience. | Still there, ate there last week. | There's one around E 53rd too. Very good | Lovely! | \+1 | Yeah they have a sister restaurant back in California I really liked called Kashiwa | Really? The sign is gone... Let me check it out, thanks | The one on w. 53rd is closed."
Times Square lunch spot with pasta bar?,"Anyone know of takeaway lunch spots / deli's around times square that have a pasta bar?  

There used to be a few but they shut down- realized I haven't seen any spots like that in ages.

Not looking for anything spectacular, just something basic I can grab for lunch at work.","I swear theres a whole foods not even 30 seconds from times sq | I think Essen does this- at least the one on Madison and 40th does | No…but you can probably do a street view on google. They are on the north side of 43rd st. Start looking just past the parking garage near the corner of 6th towards 5th. Maybe one is called toasties? | They do a pasta bar?  To clarify, not talking about pre-made, but rather where you pick your ingredients and then they cook it to order. | There are a couple of delis like this on 43rd between 5th and 6th  (closer to 6th) that might do it too. | A hot bar with pasta dishes is a pasta bar in my understanding | Do you know their names, or what they're next to? | I should have been more specific."
Where are the Punk bars?,Title. Where are the punk bars? I mean the accept anyone type punks. ,"Lucky 13 Saloon, Otto's Shrunken Head | In bk and Queens: you've got  Tv eye, anchored inn, aunt Ginny's, windjammer, Flying Fox is goth but still has punks, 


Lucky 13 and Duffs are metal, but punks hang out on occasion.

Clockwork, 169, Double Down | A bar in greenpoint. | Double down saloon | Strangelove | Pumps in Brooklyn, lol  | D.B.A. East Village, Otto’s Shrunken Head. | The Library | Clockwork bar, double down saloon, 169 bar | 1978 | What is an “accept anyone” punk bar? | Duffs, kinda | The real ones are long gone polish bar is punk adjacent in that they freely serve relatively cheap booze from early to late in a neighborhood that 50 years ago was the epicenter of a now dead subculture . Even the idea of a viable commercial enterprise based on a subculture which was defined by by DIY and corner cutting as well as being able to host raucous shows in the current New York City ecosystem is laughable the closest manhattan has to offer are bars owned by former punks and one place in particular to me stands out amongst them …beauty bar , they have for manhattan  very reasonable drinks and specials an eclectic patronage ranging from investment dude bros to homeless traveling kids , a solid line up of colorful and lovely regulars ands truly caring professional and dedicated staff and for me at least for the 20 years or so I frequented it managed to hold on to that  feeling of endless possibility that used to make the best “punk bars” inviting and cozy but also places of unforgettable experiences or at worst good drinks good music and great conversation (now it is here that i must qualify this with the fact that i haven’t been home in 10 years and haven’t rocked the traditional punk look for much longer than that ) but the truth of the matter is that the big city has moved on and generally unwavering nihilistic and anarchistic world views are hard to center one’s personality on when you are paying $3000 studio rent and the music has nothing new to say | Clockwork | The really great ones were pits when they were in their prime cbgbs , mars bar , cherry tavern back in the day were unhygienic,chaotic loud and to the uninitiated menacing places even second generation places like pyramid (still around ) coney island high and the wetlands were only punk rock when punk rockers were going there  and there arent many dyed in the wool punk rock kids left most of the good bands ,artists ,scene makers and groupies saw the writing on the wall and moved on (there is nothing more tragic than a punk kid who managed to make a living out of it so desperately clings to their already decimated punk rock persona tim Armstrong,fat mike and astro Earle all reek of desperation ) | Clockwork | Double down or Clockwork.

Love to Otto's as well- my friend works there though I haven't been. | In the 80s? | International Bar (ev) | Good argument for Niagra. Joe Strummer mural outside and some bonus Kenny Scharf art. | Since when punk bats serving food? Please so I can go | When I went to Roberta's about 2012 time period I went to a bar nearby.. it seemed more like a dive bar.. but had writing or something all over the wall so that means punk right?!. | Love Otto’s. I have every single mug they’ve put out since they opened nearly 22 years ago | the skins pull up there sometimes. i have been in the backyard when boot boys showed up and took over the space | That place is a real shithole | Closed. It’s like a sports bar/restaurant now.

EDIT: I’ve been thoroughly corrected! Ignore my misinformation. | You're not wrong.  | Not nazi punks | Technically a metal bar, I think? | Holy shit what a useless comment. | Pine Box Rock Shop | That's really cool. | Got both the 15th and 20th anniversary shirts. Definitely one of my favorite haunts. | oh fuck. i don’t like that. | That’s Kelly’s, double down is not closed | They filmed a movie or tv show there and temporarily changed the sign. Bar did not close. | No it's not lol | Well shit, I guess I'll have to go to the Vegas one | I live above it, Double Down is still very much open and unchanged. They filmed a 90s crime movie last month with Austin Butler and put up a fake facade and sign called “Ryan’s Pub” but they took it down and it’s open now. | https://youtu.be/PzHLPnGuVSQ?feature=shared | Yeahh | Def not a punk bar. | I don’t have the 20th anniversary shirt, but I’ve got the poster hanging on my fridge. 

I’m very old friends with the singer of Prof. Damage and the Whim Wham’s, so I have an excuse to go anytime they’re performing. | It depends on what type of skins they are. If they are SHARPS, the original skinheads, I’m all for it. If they are the neo-nazi skins who co-opted the movement in the 80s then fuck them. | Greenpoint has lots of Polish biker skinheads | Are you sure? I went inside the new place, it was completely remodeled and had customers. I’m in the area regularly I gotta check now, I feel crazy. | I love the Vegas location. Last time I went, I told the bartender I was a regular at the NYC spot and he bribed me with free ass juice, an obscene bumper sticker, and a Super Bowl mousepad to tell everyone I like the Vegas version better. 

So, uh, I like the Vegas version better. But the NYC location is alive and well. | I know, I’m just saying it’s what this person was referring to. Also, idk was kind of punk adjacent when I lived in Bushwick in 2014ish. | i can assure you these were the racist type. | yeah i used to see them up north in greenpoint on manhattan ave (tommy’s tavern) but i had hoped they wouldn’t infiltrate A bar. | I was there 2 weeks ago | Well you’re making me think I’m crazy! I never went inside.  I walked by one day and the sign was changed and I thought it closed. 

Then the next day I walked by again and they were filming. The next day the film crew was gone and the double down sign was restored. This was like a month ago. 

Best thing to do is go and report back lol. | The Vegas one has a charm that's totally different from the city but still awesome.

I just learned about this dish from my friends. I always saw pictures of it but never knew it was known to be so heavenly delicious. I’m so intrigued!

I, also will admit, judged it like a bad book cover. I always thought it would be flavorless but it seems to be gas.","Lou Yau Kee | Hai nan chicken house in Brooklyn is pretty good. That’s their specialty. Eim khao in elmhurst too. There are a few food courts in Manhattan that have it, but I forgot their names. In general though most Malaysian restaurants offer this dish.

Thai Food in Hell's Kitchen,"In reviewing another restaurant on Google Maps, I stumbled upon a high-rated Thai restaurant... then another and another, all in the same area. My husband and I are huge fans of Thai food, and we're always looking for new spots to hit.

What do you all think of the following places, and/or if you could only choose one out of the three (we are likely moving out of the area next year and only have so much time!), which would it be?

- Valla Table
- LumLum
- Chalong NYC

TIA!","Chalong - southern Thai so seafood focused. Different to your typical Thai and very very good (similar to Fishcheeks)

If you do Pure Thai - get the pork and crab dry noodles | LumLum and Wondee Siam are the best | Pure thai | Chalong is great, Wondee Siam as well | Wondee Siam, Chalong, and Pure Thai

We are truly blessed in HK, all the other Thai places are good, these just happen to be great. | ThongLor all day. | zoob zib is great but more Hudson yards | Chalong is so damn good!!! 

I also really loved ViV when I lived in Hells Kitcheb | Chalong for sure | Wondee, pure thai, noodies are my fav. I’ve been to all 3 places you mentioned. Wondee has a secret thai menu with super authentic stuff, get the ratchaburi noodles at Pure thai, get the fish cakes at noodies.

Lumlum:  get the goong yang, my fav dish there. If you get the crying tiger, MAKE sure you use the sauce because the steak is bland as hell without it.

Chalong: not bad, get the baern golae/shrimp tacos with coconut crisps

Valla table: my fav food was the lemongrass sausage, i found the nuer tom bai horapa to be not even remotely spicy despite the waiter saying it was. If you like spicy food, avoid this place. | Valla Table, is a good option for the area! Narrow restaurant, so you feel like you’re on top of each other, but overall good. | Valla Table is a block from me and my go to for Thai food. It’s great! That said, if I lived in another neighborhood, not sure I’d travel for it. | VIV - Cashew king and Rama 9 | Of your list, LumLum would be the one I most recommend. Wondee Siam is close by and also a great one to check out. | HK is crazy with their Thai. LumLum, Chalong, Valla Table, and Pure Thai Cookhouse are all exceptionally good. | If you're willing to venture out of HK: Thai Villa, Mitr, Soothr, and Fish Cheeks are all amazing Thai. Soothr is my favorite from that list but Thai Villa has very impressive decor on top of excellent food | wondee siam | LumLum is great but a lot of the Thai food in HK is very good, hard to go wrong. | Pure Thai ❤️ | Second LumLum, have had so many incredible meals there | At 51st & 9th? Any dish recs? | Yes | Oooooo this is a new one I'll have to add to our list. Thanks! | Agreed! Der Krung is also great | I also like zoob zib !!! | Just Googled ViV. Looks like it has a cool vibe, too. | Thanks for the recs and tips! We definitely enjoy spice, so Valla will likely be out for us. | We've done Thai Villa, Mitr, and Soothr. Mitr and Soothr were definitely our favorites food-wise. The drinks were also excellent. I'm usually not a mixed drink fan, but they were great!

I only asked about Hell's Kitchen because I stumbled upon those 3 spots as being highly rated, and we had never received recs for any Thai places in HK. | So happy this page is still going and still good. I went like, every day for lunch back in the 2010s | What are your favorite dishes? | Their duck noodle soup with hand pulled noodles is the stuff dreams are made of. | The khao soi is amazing | Cashew shrimp | The ratchaburi crab and pork noodles (I get them in soup) and the sukhothai soup are standouts, but everything is good.  | HK is known for their Thai restaurants! Pure Thai is great and so is Chalong. Enjoy! | Awesome! Soothr has a sister restaurant in Chelsea called Sappe that focuses on grilled meats (I personally like Soothr more though). HK Thai is consistently good but IMHO tend to be more ""typical""/mainstream Thai | Thanks for the additional rec!"

They also have a location near union square | Go to Google maps and see what’s on the street where the new S&S is. | omggggg this definitely sounds the most likely and I’m truly LOL’ing my hazy memory of the pronunciation 😭😭😭 | I THINK WE HAVE A WINNER 🗣️ this looks soooo much like what they were describing !!! that name sounds correct too- thank you so much!!! | girllll you know I tried this before resorting to reddit!! | Def peace food cafe (pfc). Get the fried chikn | Oh great! Púsù is not near a salt and straw tho!! | They probably meant Salt + Charcoal  | I haven’t heard of that
Cheap late night bites in Queens/Manhattan?,"A buddy of mine is coming to visit me around 10:30 today. I wanna take him to get some affordable late night food.
I have heard that Jackson Hts and Astoria have a lot of late night spots open, but the choices are endless. Can anybody recommend me somewhere thats affordable and open till 1-2am?

He’s a big fan of mexican/latin, halal, and chinese food.","Birria Landia is what I can think of off the top of my head for Jackson Heights, and maybe the Fuchka carts. | Manhattan

-	Grand St Skewer Cart
-	Yunnan Rice Noodle
-	Patacon Pisao
-	Shawarma Bay

Queens

-	Taqueria Coatzingo
-	Zyara
-	Birria Landia
-	Jai Sang Ma
-	Fuskahouse
-	Kusina Pinoy Bistro | In Astoria, Shah's Halal is right by the 30th Ave N train station and is open till 2am. 

In the same block (North side of 30th Ave between 30th/31st Sts) is a good Mexican place variously called El Grill/Athen's Grill/Sports Bar that's open till at least 3. Both are great value. | King Souvlaki | Mamouns | 7st burger, raising canes, stuff’d, eat it, Cristina’s, rolling heroes are all open late and in queens | Haha we already had birrialandia on the list, thank you.
As for your other recommendation, are those just all around or at a certain location? | I buss down Yunnan Rice Noodle like three times a month I fucking love that place so much sometimes it makes me want to cry. | Will hit up 1-2 of these thank you! | Heard eat it was good, might check that out | They're Bengali and there are a bunch of them in front of the DR on the corner of 73rd st and 37th Ave pretty close by to Birria Landia. My gf is Bengali and she's brought me there a couple times, I don't remember which cart she said was the legit one, I just know she only ever goes to one. Also forgot for Astoria there's Mahmoud' halal truck. | No problem. Enjoy!"
1st time tourists in NYC,"Staying LES for a several days. What places to eat that are low key, cozy, good tasting and classic? We are middle aged Californians, not really foodies, but I am looking for vibe and NYC experience. Nothing in high demand that absolutely needs a res. Some things on our itinerary so far: seeing a show on Saturday (oh Mary), the cloisters, the Met, Central Park, exploring a few neighborhoods, etc. ","Make reservations, too frustrating without them. | Frank takes reservations but I've never needed one (88 2 Ave). Good Italian food with a LES atmosphere. Pretty sure it's cash only btw | You should definitely try some Dominican food when you visit the cloisters.. Washington Heights and inwood is the Mecca | LES? Some diverse options include Russ & Daughters Cafe, Yopparai, Congee Village, Shinzo Omakase, Clinton St Baking Company, Ernesto's, Dirt Candy. Definitely hit Essex St Market. | Freeman’s. Been a favorite for 15 years. | Clinton St Baking Co (which specializes in pancakes and the like) can be very busy at brunch but is great at night. Cozy, yummy, and easy to make a reservation or walk in.

Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya 

Frank 

Economy Candy is a really great candy store.

The LES is great to explore.  Around the LES there are fantastic neighborhoods to explore - Chinatown, Soho, the East Village, South Street Seaport all feel quite different from each other.  You might want to head over the Brooklyn Bridge to explore DUMBO. | Frank, Veselka, Katz’s, Russ & Daughters Cafe, Clinton St for pancakes/ breakfast, Scarr’s for a slice, John’s of 12th St | Abraco for coffee.

Casa Adela for PuertoRican food. | Visit Chinatown! So many different options and most of the food is super cheap! | Buenos Aries | I mean your in LES its a neighborhood that has better dining than most U.S. cities. A lot of the tourist stuff is there (Katz Deli, Clinton Street Bakery, Russ and Daughters), but if you don't want that you basically have tons of good options in terms of things like Thai, Japanese, Vietnamese and cheap eats. There is also michelin star places like 63 Clinton. Lower East Side is also immediately adjacent to China town and East village and you don't even have to get on the train so you also have access to all the restaurants there.

I would heavily look into Infatuation, which is kind of like eater, and has a high presence in NYC (especially since they are owned by JP Morgan's travel arm). Their website/app has listicles by neighborhood that summarizes recommendation. You can literally just google infaturation east village, Lower East Side restaurants, China town. They'll list spots, their rating out of 10 and what the restaurant is good for. They even have filters for solo dinners, causal dinners , impressing out of towners etc. Here is an example of their listicles:

[https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-lower-east-side-restaurants](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-lower-east-side-restaurants)

They have an app that shows you  exactly where things are on map and search function.

I also live in this neighborhood and disagree with the need for reservations. There are plenty of places you can walk into or make reservations the day of on a Saturday or Friday. Don't expect to get in hot items, but plenty of casual neighborhood places can take walk ins.

I will note for your vacation expect that any place you walk into with table service will be a 50$ minimum spend per person without alcohol. For a fast casual meal expect to pay 20 to 30$. This is the reality of lower east side. If your eating exclusively Chinese/Vietnames you can expect to be may be 20 percent cheaper. | Go to Le French Diner. It’s in LES. They don’t take reservations. It’s legitimately one of the best restaurants in the city and a is a cozy hole in the wall spot with an open kitchen. It’ll be fantastic. | Minetta Tavern in west village for old school cozy vibes | Sushi by M is a sneaky gem if you’re into omakase. They usually prefer reservations, but they’re not difficult to get at all. I’ll always recommend them | You must go to Supper! It’s in east village so not far from LES.

They take Resys but you 2 might be able to walk in for the bar if early. It’s what I think of as classic nyc Sunday family Italian vibes, and the most affordable yet delicious option. Cash only but there’s an atm at the bodega near it. | Lucia Pizza of SoHo is on my list to try. | For a chill meal in the LES, you can try Eastwood. A local bar with much better than average bar-type food and a well-curated beer & wine selection. I don't even know if they take reservations. | I live in the LES, great choice to stay here. Central enough for transit but also enough going on here that you don't have to leave to do fun stuff. 
If you're into live jazz at all - highly recommend going to the Village Vanguard/Smalls, very uniquely NYC. Or see a comedy show at the Comedy Cellar. 

Brooklyn Heights is my favourite NYC neighbourhood - if it's a nice day I'd go out there and walk around there/Cobble Hill. Brooklyn's botanical gardens are also gorgeous and the nearby BK museum is phenomenal ad well. | East Village: Veselka, especially after 8:00 or 9:00 PM

West Village: Elephant & Castle. Great vibe. It’s been there for half-a-century. Elephant Burger is the most underrated burger in the city. | Hearth | Casa Adela on C is a classic | I like Joe Allen’s before or after a show. And The Little Owl in the West Village is a longtime favorite | I’m very familiar with the LES. As you’ll see tonight it is a major nightlife district and is stacked with great restaurants. 

Barrio Chino is very good but always a wait to get in (but usually not that bad). Dim Sum Palace is excellent. Frank is also very good. Izakaya Juraku does an excellent job. Mictlan Mexico is an understated place, but very good tacos.  99 Favor Taste isn’t the greatest meal you’ll have, but it is a fun AYCE experience. The BBQ there is better than the hot pot. It’s touristy, but Il Cortile in Little Italy does a good job. Particularly if you get their Sunday Gravy. Omar’s Kitchen is also excellent as is Pig and Khao. 

Thai Diner is amazing, but getting in can be a nightmare.  | Black Cat LES for super-chill coffee | You’re staying in one of the best neighborhoods in NYC so don’t spend all of your time leaving it. Here’s my list. 

* Cafe China (Szechuan) 
* Scarr’s Pizza
* Superiority Burger (vegan/vegetarian) 
* ⁠COTE (Korean steakhouse, 1 Michelin star) 
* Emmet’s on Grove (Tavern style pizza) 
* Soothr (Thai) 
* Ci Siamo (Italian)
* Rolo’s (American) 
* Grand Street Pizza
* Fini Pizza 
* L’Artusi (for pasta)
* Momofuku Noodle Bar (fusion) 
* Saigon Social (Vietnamese) 
* Taqueria Ramirez (Mexican) 
* Tompkins Square Bagels
* Yellow Rose (Tex Mex) 
* Union Square Cafe (New American) 
* S&P (Jewish deli) 
* Empire Diner 
* Cafè Maud | Caffe Reggio over in the west village is an easy tril and an NYC classic, open until 3am and a really pleasant vibe after dark. Definitely go to Russ and Daughters, and also check out Yonah Schimmel’s for a proper NYC knish. There are some classic spots in Chinatown worth checking out, like Wo Hop, for a classic New York vibe. Controversial opinion but skip Katz. It’s delicious but the sandwiches are too big to eat and the prices are insane. Also far too crowded to be tolerable | Patsy’s pizza (UWS, Midtown)
Veselka (LES)
Ziggle Tofu House (Korean food, 3rd ave & 37th I think?)
Katz’s Deli | Johns of 12th!! if its a weekend request the back room, it has amazing ambiance and i think you should be able to get a res a few days in advance by just calling--super classic red sauce place in the EV | Ramen - mr taka ramen, ivan ramen 

Sushi - Douska (but kazunori is better)

French - le French (small so it could have a wait) or Lucien (great ppl watching)

Seafood - cervos 

American - wildair  

Bakery - supermoon

Drinks - subject, skin contact, bar belly 

Nearby - somtum der 🤤, upside pizza, red gate bakery, court st grocers, kazunori | Especially in the cold weather. No reservations by default mean you're sitting outside. | Good to know. I’ll research some places I’d like to try to plan ahead. | Franks is good, supper similar but further east. These are more Italian American red sauce style, for OP, I might also recommend Il Posto Acanto down the street from supper. More Italian-ish, really good vibes. | And I missed the LES part.. walking distance to Katz’s deli  and Chinatown. 
In Chinatown I would hit Noodletown on the Bowery | Good suggestion! Any particular spots? | Made a res for our first night, thanks! | Gena's on 1st has much better food - and killer sancocho. | Yes, definitely an option for us! | Thanks! I’m getting the feeling from the replies that it wont be stressful finding a cool place to eat. | Sounds perfect | \*Cobble Hill | agree on E&C!  great vibe.  if the OP is good for the village, there are so many options.  Arturo’s Coal Oven Pizza, perhaps? | [Malecon](https://maleconnyc.com). Broadway at 175th maybe. | Malecon, as mentioned, is good all around. It’s a couple subway stops south of the Clositers
Elsa, la Reina de Chicharron is great but somewhat smaller. It’s just north of the park on broadway and academy | Great!  Let me know what you think!  Hope you have a great time. If you need any off the beaten path suggestions let me know | Thanks! I will check it out! | There are many great places in Chinatown, but usually no atmosphere or service, “just” great food.  Try Hwa Yuan on east broadway for a more genteel experience.  For down and dirty, go to NY Noodletown or Deluxe New Green Bo. | It won't. I wouldn't wait anywhere more than 10 minutes if your not a foodie. The thing with NYC and especially this part of NYC is that even the neighborhood restaurants is better than what you'd find in most major cities. They won't survive if they aren't. There are at least 5 restaurants doing the same cuisine they are in walking distance. The general rule of thumb is don't go to anywhere with less than a 4.4/5 on google. 

The other thing is be a bit careful in china town. There is a lot of tourist trap restaurants there that aren't very good. That is one part of the city i'd be more discerning and also little italy. Both these neighobhoors are walkable from LES. | You'll need a res. | typo - thanks! corrected"
Seafood broth ramen?,Any good seafood broth ramen in NYC?  Only one I know of is the smoked dashi from Torishin.,"-	Susuru - Gyokai Ramen
-	Tabetomo - Gyokai Ramen special usually for the winter
-	Shuya - has had shio snapper, salmon ramens ; shio chicken and clam ramen
-	Okonomi / Yuji Ramen - specializes in fish based broths 
-	Ramen Ishida (Chelsea) - their Tsukemen broth is chicken and fish | tonchin! | For seafood only, the bowls at Yuji Ramen. For seafood forward, the clam and chicken shio at Shuya, the 80s niboshi shoyu at Ishida, and the tori gyokai tsukemen at Okiboru. Tabetomo also runs a tonkotsu gyokai special sometimes. | Rokc | Tomo tomo at 6 1/2 avenue market is really good tbh"
I reviewed Sarge's Deli after our recent trip to the City.  Who else loves Sarge's?,"This week's Saboscrivner review is for a fantastic restaurant outside of my usual Central Florida radius: the legendary Sarge's Delicatessen and Diner in New York City's Murray Hill neighborhood.  I recently took my wife to NYC for our 15th anniversary, and even though we had a fancy anniversary dinner somewhere else, this much more casual dinner at Sarge's was my favorite meal we shared on this trip, after a day apart doing our own things in the city.  
  
I compare Sarge's to the even more famous and historic Katz's Delicatessen a lot in this review, because when people think of NY Jewish delis and pastrami sandwiches in particular, they think of Katz's.  We've been to Katz's before, on previous trips, and while the pastrami is second to none, I've never found the experience to be a pleasant or fun one.  Sarge's was so much more laid-back, with no lines, no waiting, comfy booths, and a patient and friendly server.  It also has a much larger menu, with so many options beyond overstuffed deli sandwiches.  Of course, the overstuffed deli sandwiches there are AWESOME.    
  
Before you ask, YES, they have onion rings, and YES, of course I tried them!  What did I think?  Click below to read my full, detailed review on The Saboscrivner food blog to find out!  And if you've also experienced the pure joy of dining at Sarge's Delicatessen and Diner before, what is your go-to order, and would you change it to something else on your next visit?  
[https://saboscrivner.com/2024/11/09/sarges-delicatessen-and-diner-new-york/](https://saboscrivner.com/2024/11/09/sarges-delicatessen-and-diner-new-york/) ","It's my favorite of the delis. The prices are more reasonable and the quality of the corned beef is better than Katz's not to mention everything else outside of the pastrami which is marginally worse but $10 cheaper. Only thing I dislike there of what I've tried is the mushroom barley | Have been going to Sarge's regularly for more than 20 years.  Back when the underground poker clubs were all in Midtown South or Kips Bay, I'd stumble out of one at 4:30 am and roll over to Sarge's for something awesome (if horrifically unhealthy).  The corned beef/pastrami are excellent (if not quite as Katz's with respect to the pastrami).  The corned beef hash is made in house and amazing.  The pierogen with fried onions are superior to the mediocrities served at Veselka.  The egg creams and the smoked fish were good.  The (now dearly departed) short rib flanken was OK.  Just a landmark of an older NYC (think Hopper's Nighthawks) that survived into this century.

When they were shut for a year because of the fire, I mourned.  When they stopped staying open all night because of COVID, I mourned some more.

They're still good, but they're not what they were.  I miss being younger when the overnight waitress knew my order by heart. | I like sarge's for deli and matzoh ball soup. I am always disappointed by the latkes. They're like rocks. | I loved that place when I worked nearby. Haven’t been since the fire… | [deleted] | Low-key my favorite deli | I liked Sarge’s a lot. My only quibble was I thought they sliced their pastrami too thin. But that was a very minor quibble - it was otherwise delicious. I got the half pastrami/matzo ball soup deal. | Honestly my favorite slice of cheesecake in the city | I once ordered the pastrami sandwich for takeout. Extremely overpriced at $27 and one of the worst sandwiches I ever had (couldn’t even eat half of it). Don’t think of going back. | We tried Veselka on our previous trip five years ago and thought it was fine, and some things were really good, but the whole meal wasn't as good as we hoped.  This is my review from that visit:  
[https://saboscrivner.com/2019/05/30/the-new-york-adventure-part-2-veselka/](https://saboscrivner.com/2019/05/30/the-new-york-adventure-part-2-veselka/) | Katz's pastrami is absolutely better, but I thought Sarge's pastrami is still better than most places, and it was a much more pleasant overall experience. | I got cheesecake at Junior's two nights before (great cheesecake, but I didn't like that sticky, gelatinous strawberry topping), so I couldn't justify getting cheesecake at Sarge's too.  Good to know for the future. | That's a damn shame!  I'm sorry it was such a disappointment for you."
Dorsia moves to $100 / year membership,"here's the text from the announcement email:

*Thank you for being one of our early and loyal members. Your support and feedback have helped shape the platform into what it is today.


In just two years, we’ve hit significant milestones on our mission to revolutionize the hospitality industry. Nearly 200,000 people have now taken Dorsia for a spin and as a result, we’re already seeing a positive impact on the perilous state of restaurant economics.

 

We’ve expanded our reach to in-demand destinations around the world, from Ibiza and Saint-Tropez to cultural capitals like London and Dubai. Coming soon: ski havens Aspen and Courchevel, glamorous winter escape St. Barths, and Mexico City—just in time for Zona Maco.


We’ve also enhanced our pricing model, with many minimum spends now starting at $50, and unveiled a redesigned in-app homepage that makes it easier than ever to discover what Dorsia has to offer, including our soon-to-drop VIP Art Basel experience and an invite-only party during the fair worth booking a flight to Miami for. In the coming weeks, we’ll start rolling out new in-app content features and culture calendar highlights to help guide your social agenda. 


In the coming weeks, we’re launching an evolved membership experience, which I feel strongly redefines the concept. We’re not blind to membership fatigue. Slapping a fee on top of regular venues is an irritating trend but we’re not here to charge for air.  

 

Just like we revolutionized the restaurant economy with instant access to impossible tables and our get-up-and-go Dorsia Pay technology, we’re laying the groundwork to bring the same innovation to experiences and nightlife. To prepare for this next phase, we’re introducing a minimal subscription fee to access the app.


As a loyal member, we’re inviting you to take advantage of an exclusive Friends & Family nominal rate of $100 annually—a lifetime rate only available for a limited number of users. Additionally, to bring your circle along, we’ve added five extra nominations to your account, so your friends can join before our full paywall goes live.

 

Thank you again for your commitment to Dorsia. I can’t wait to show you what’s next.*",">We’re not blind to membership fatigue. Slapping a fee on top of regular venues is an irritating trend but we’re not here to charge for air.

Sure, Jan. | > In just two years, we’ve hit significant milestones on our mission to revolutionize the hospitality industry

yes, you're making it worse

> we’re already seeing a positive impact on the perilous state of restaurant economics.

I'm sure your pockets are seeing a positive impact. I don't understand why should I be subjected to pay you when these restaurants are available on Resy. You're basically a glorified scalper. Taking a limited resource that is available for free, and charging a premium for it. And as a subscription??? Lol, I hope this business crashes and burns. People buying into this are idiots, and they're making the problem they're trying to solve worse. 

> We’re not blind to membership fatigue. Slapping a fee on top of regular venues is an irritating trend but we’re not here to charge for air. 

Your actions say otherwise and these are empty words. | I've read that a few times and I don't really understand what you're actually getting for the $100. 

They already charge ludicrous rates for reservations (eg over $300/person min spend at places like Torrisi, pushing $600+ for table of 2). Unless it's for business I don't see the point. | If only we weren’t able to see this financial model coming from fifty miles away…

These “modernizations” are wolves in sheep’s clothing; they destroy the culinary fabric of the city so the investors of some half-baked application can suck away our discretionary spending dollars. | Nobody goes there anymore | Speaking of reasonable | Parasites | From the moment people get rich, they're cultivated as marks. You have to be such a moron to read that text and think ""yes, luxury"" instead of ""scam."" | Dorsia sucks tbh, had it for two years and zero actual exclusivity to it or anything lol + if you show up to most of these restaurants you can get the manager to get you the reservation without the deposit | Hard eye roll. They have like 15 restaurants in New York. | Its offerings in NYC are pretty bad. It’s a mix of places you can easily get into and super overpriced carbone reservations. | I was super excited to sign up for this and literally haven’t used it. It only has a couple restaurants I remotely care about, and the minimum spend is insane. I don’t really drink, so I had no way of using it. | [So.. pay $100 for access to overprice scalped reservations? Can I pull a $100 out of my wallet and light it on fire for fun if I want to too?](https://i.imgur.com/n6uRAMe.gif) | The emperor has no clothes. People will legit fall for anything these days it’s crazy… This is NYC. More than enough amazing restaurants that this app is absurd | So is it $100 per year AND also a minimum spend? Or just $100? | What is this | In order to honor the origin of this app's name in the most authentic way possible, I propose a recreation of a scene, thusly:

r/Foodnyc : "" You like Huey Lewis and the News?""

Dorsia owners : ""Um, they're okay.""

[continues](https://genius.com/Mary-harron-american-psycho-you-like-huey-lewis-and-the-news-annotated) | Who? | When do in demand restaurants just start charging for reservations that are priced by time. Obviously this is where it's all going. We are in the ticket scalping phase of reservations. The brokers make the money. Soon enough like sports teams, hotels and airlines restaurants will resort to dynamic pricing to maximize their revenue and capture the money ticket brokers once made. | gross | Lmao. | Wait is this really or an elaborate joke from Bret Easton Ellis ? | I simply am not there. | https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flex-concierge/id6502918128 | well, the free app and access will now cost $100 / year. so the money goes to dorsia. i don't know anything about their business, but if you've made the decision to from free to paid, you likely think that your customers will pay. | Too crowded | Same here. Three quarters of the restaurants listed for NYC are easy mid week walk ins or can be booked without too much hassle days in advance with a bit of planning. 

The only advantage is literally for people who want to drop by Carbone within 48hrs. | $100 per year to use the app at all. | A reference to American Psycho | there really ins't a benefit to the restaurant to sell the reservation itself. what they really want is a minimum cover spend above their average. and that's what dorsia is meant to accomplish. i suppose restaurants can or should have varying menu pricing based on demand, but not sure they're well set up for that. though that's the entire idea behind ""happy hour"" in the industry. (i don't work for or care about dorsia and have never used it, but i signed up for it early on). | How was Dorsia making money previously? Were they taking a cut of the minimum spend? | Meh. Does anyone even go to Carbone a second time? | Right! And Torrisi | Yea | With the wide choice of amazing restaurants in the city, is it even worthwhile going through the hassle of going once? | Right? Even if you’re desperate for great red-sauce American Italian in the village, you have so many options. | Depends on how curious you are."
Dim sum/chinese recs for thanksgiving day?,"Hello! Some friends and I are looking for recs for a thanksgiving day feast. We do not want traditional thanksgiving food - in our dreams we’d do dim sum, Chinese food, or something along those lines. Manhattan, Queens or Brooklyn would all be workable. We’d love a nice comfortable vibe. Any recommendations for something that would be open that day? Thank you!!","Wu’s Wonton King ✨ | Doing this was one of the most memorable Thanksgiving my husband and I had, dim sum and then walking home over the Brooklyn Bridge, city was a beautiful ghost town. | -	House of Joy

It’s in flushing. In Manhattan, Jing Fong and Golden Unicorn. 

I wouldn’t really listen to any other recommendations to be honest lol. | Great NY Noodle town or Pings | Favorite spot is Seng Seafood on East Broadway. Outstanding and still reasonable | See if Asian Jewels in Flushing is open.  best dim sum in NYC IMHO, though I havent tried sunset park places. | try a potluck with your friends, everyone makes a different dim sum dish | Love it thank you! | Ooh thanks! | Haha a person who knows what they like! Thank you! | [deleted] | I’m a third on Wu’s, although the wait can be awful. | If you want made to order dim sum instead of hot and fresh off the carts, I don’t know how to help you."
UES Laid Back Restaurant Good Food,"My friends and I will be making our first visit to NYC next week, and I am looking for a restaurant in the Upper Eastside with really good food and a laid-back vibe/good ambiance. I am also trying to stay away from Instagram-hyped places. Any recommendations from the locals would be greatly appreciated.","Zabb Putawn (thai) and AOC East (my favorite not authentic carbonara in the city on 1st between 82 and 83rd. | Tha pharyna (Thai, is on the Michelin guide),Ravagh (Persian), Bombay chowk (indian), Adan adyar bhavan (South Indian Dosa),Peng’s noodle fork (Ramen), Super taste (Chinese) | up thai

Heidi's house

caffe buon gusto | Flex mussels | Le moulin | The Penrose, Kaia, Heidi's, chez Nick | The drunken munkey on 92nd Street is reliably good Indian food."
Decision Paralysis!,"Visited New York multiple times. I've loved the food every time I've visited. Unfortunately, I'm only passing through for one meal this weekend, and another meal next weekend on my way out of town. There are too many choices to pick only TWO meals to enjoy in and around NYC.

One of my first trips, had some amazing Korean BBQ. Of course I've done the typical NYC standards of pizza and dogs, but I want something that will blow my mind. I'm a world traveler, and I've found all of my favorite world cuisines being offered somewhere in New York: Japanese BBQ, authentic Greek gyros, Cacio e Pepe, Brazilian steak, etc etc etc.

I'm literally unable to decide. Too many choices to pick from. If you had one or two meals to eat in NYC, what would you pick?","Do you have preferred neighborhoods, price range, and vibes? 

Really depends what you’re in the mood for. Do you want foods you’ve never had before or hard to find cuisines?

My personal picks would be Shuya and Red Hook Tavern. | If you’ve never been: Katz’s  

Second one (for me) would either be a great burger, trying to get a walk-in at an upscale or American-Chinese at wo hop or similar | If you can afford it, an NYC steakhouse w/ great wine, Sparks or Keen’s.  If you can’t afford it, the funky Le Relais de Venise - Entrecote, which is a lot of fun.  Or a wine bar with food - Somm Time in the LES (burger) or the very sophisticated Aldo Sohm. | +1 on aldo sohm - amazing wine bar and the food is actually decent"
Does Emily have one of the top 5 burgers in the West Village?,I went Emily near Houston Street for the first time to try their Emmy Burger and was unimpressed. I was inspired to go from an Instagram post that noted this place as a top 5 burger in that part of town. The burger wasn’t seasoned the way I’d like and it was sloppy because of the sauce. Has anyone else gone? What are your thoughts?,"It’s good when done properly but I find it inconsistent | I agree-- I was wildly disappointed by that burger.  Minetta Tavern's burger nearby is a classic. | Go to Fairfax on W4 instead and get the burger there (a la Bar Sardine). | Nope.  Underwhelming. | better off at Minetta or Gramercy Tavern | They used to be? They’re really hit or miss now. It’s not a conventional/classic burger and I think now you can find 5 burgers in WV that would out perform Emily’s at a taste test easily. 

When they first came on scene, that was a flavor profile everyone loved. People still do but ehhhh

I had a very very fat day earlier this year where I took a burger addict to Emily (mid af: their sauce tasted a bit off, bun didn’t have its usual give and their was no char. Unpleasant, really. It was the only time I’d had a burger like that from them but I haven’t been back. 

Anyways, later I ended up in Brooklyn at Bernie’s and was like “This is 10x better than that shit earlier” and Bernie’s isn’t in my top 40.

Made it back to Manhattan and went to Mother’s Ruin in mf Nolita and again said “this is 10x better than Emily”. 

Emily not my cuppa tea. Shit was goooooooood when I first had it but that shits played out like The Weeknd | It’s been years since I would have actually recommended Emily or Emmy Squared (and I was a major fan of the latter at one point). Not sure why they’re still on the hype lists. | Yeah the burger is no good. I’ve been eating a different burger from different places and compiling my reviews to eventually publish them. I can say without a shadow of the doubt, this burger doesn’t make top 5 from the list | No it was a wet mess | How does it compare to Emily in Brooklyn? | I think it’s a great-tasting burger but not one of the best ever and certainly not worth $30 or whatever it costs. 

My personal preference is a smash burger, so I’m not a huge fan of super thick burgers, which is why I wasn’t 100% in love with Emily’s. | It's one of the burgers I would have told you was top 5 maybe a few years ago. Back when umami burger still existed on 6th Ave and I was on my burger tour it was amazing. Can't say how it tastes now but I'm more of a smash burger person. Strange Flavor, Harlem Shake, and 7th street all hit for under $15. | The best burgers are sub 10 backs tbh, these expensive burgers are a scam. Idc what the influencers say | It was a pretty meh burger | Thought it was very overrated when I had it. | I got it once and it was overcooked | Good, not great. | It’s good don’t get me wrong but by no means is it a top burger in the city imo | I've had it twice. 

I thought it was too decadent to be in the running for a top burger spot the first time.

The second time I kind of liked it. I'll mention the second time I got it well done. Which I might recommend, as crazy as that sounds.

I'll call it top 10. | Really really good | Originally? Yes. Now, no.

When it first came out in Brooklyn and was off menu with a limited number each night it used to be great...then it became a regular item and was still good and consistent. Unfortunately the quality has declined in recent years and is so inconsistent now - often a wet mess - and there are so many other options, that it wouldn't be anywhere remotely near the top 5 now. 

For burgers in the WV, Minetta is king. | Emily’s burger was so mediocre. I’d also recommend Minetta or Gramercy Tavern. Had Minetta’s more recently and it did not disappoint. If you’re interested in a smash burger, 7th St Burger would be my top choice. Do NOT go to Hamburger America!! Went 2 weeks ago and it was inedible. | Agree on the above that best burgers are ~10 bucks. Burgerhead on 6th Ave is my fave in that part of town, also McDonald’s cut fries in tallow, pretty damn good. | does emily have one of the top five burgers on the corner of downing and bedford? | Hard agree! Miss Bar Sardine so much, glad they kept the burger | I haven’t been to the one in Brooklyn yet, but I’d imagine that one is better. This was my first experience with Emily so I’m curious what others think about different locations. | I ate the one in BK first and it was great. | $27 of mediocrity at best. | Ahhh umami burger. Now that was good at the time, and was identical to the burgers at the OG LA branch. | The influencers are paid by PR company, or there is a give-and-take with free food involved. | I just had Gotham Burger Social Club. It was great! 12 bucks for a double cheeseburger with all the fixings. It was worth the price. 

I agree, the expensive burgers are a bit scammy. they always try to do something to the burger to ""set it apart"" and that usually is a bit of a turn off for  me. 

Make it simple and basic. | That seems so obvious yet I still needed someone to spell it out for me. Thank you. | Facts. | Hot take based on the rest of the thread. | Where do you get these mcd’s fries in tallow?? | Yah, Emily Brooklyn is the burger that people talk about, no one actually ranks the WV one as top tier (it's good, just not special). | Why was this downvoted? It's the truest thing you can say. Plus, half the time people in here are influencers or PR people trying to gin up business or steal YOUR recs for their Insta | Fwiw I like the 7th st on mcdougal, hamburger America or the smacking burger inside the gas station in the neighborhood

Edited to add corner bistro if you want a more classic fat burger, love corner bistro | Butter next door to 7th is also great. They have a chicken sandwich | +1 for Smacking burger. honestly was super impressed, and the price point is unbeatable | I went to Butter yesterday. Very solid burger indeed. | It tugs at my heartstrings cause it has some in n out homage"

"Awesome empanadas at Criollas (Hell's Kitchen, Turnstyle Market)",,"This place is great. Empanada Mama has been a reliable spot for me for 20 years but this is a tasty and totally different version. Two or three is a totally satisfying meal. Good sauces. Fresh product. | I love their caprese, their others are good too but idk that was the standout one for me | https://www.criollasempanadas.com/

Yes, they're pricier than Empanada Mama, maybe some would call them bougie empanadas.  Don't care, they're great.

The first was the Malbec-beef one, which I got at the HK location.  As you can see from the menu, it's beef, olives, and caramelized onions.  All flavors came through clearly and it was damn delicious.  The hot sauce worked really well with it too, although I couldn't tell you exactly what was in it.

The second one was spinach, mozzarella, and onions, from the Turnstyle Market in the 59th St station.  I saw from some old photos that the cheese used to be Asiago, and the current formula *is* something that could be done without flavor (e.g. some random pizzeria that doesn't know what it's doing), but it was also excellent.  Sealed my confidence in the rest of their menu, and frankly, it's weird to find some eats that I think are worth specifically going to the Turnstyle Market for. | Thanks; will check them out this weekend! | I’ve only been there once, but they had really really good hot chocolate too! | Decent for Argentine style empanadas; like empanada mamá / Berimbau more

Buenos Aires restaurant has better empanadas if you really want Argentine style | I found them to be greasy without any crispiness or crunch. | They are incredibly generic | I still can't wrap my brain around eating in a subway station.  I am old. | Yup, I still love Empanada Mama but this place scratches a different itch that I didn't even know I had. | I definitely wanna try them all now. | The outer edge of the crust on mine was pretty crispy, it got softer as I moved inward, but I liked that just fine.  Maybe it had to do with them being baked instead of fried, I dunno, but I loved it.  Can't say I found either of them to be overly greasy. | It’s shocking that they’re still in business with empanada mama a few blocks away | Mamas are way better"

Should I try Mah-Ze-Dar first? | 100% agree with you on items being too sweet but the brownie imo is rich chocolate where you can taste cacao. it's not at all sweet. | Is it?

Sweet Rehab - Thoughts? Any other bakery/ dessert options in SoHo? ,Sweet Rehab seems extremely expensive so wanted to get the subs thoughts on whether it’s worth it. Otherwise any recommendations for dessert/ bakery around the Soho area? Can be extremely casual as long as it tastes great ,"Personally I found it ridiculously priced and didn't anything there that was unforgettably good. Librae is not far from there I would recommend that over Sweet Rehab any day. Or go to La Cabra in Soho. Crispy Heaven has an amazing almond cake. | Petit chou. | It’s incredibly expensive but the treats there are really really good. Not sure if they are worth the price but you won’t be disappointed | I personally love their truffle madeleines and the mille feuilles. The other desserts to me are meh. It is expensive but they use better quality ingredients and I think when you think about how time consuming it is to make french pastries, it really ends up being worth it. 

More like the occasional treat, but sucks that they changed their dine in policy and raised some of their prices. 

Truffle madeleines used to be $30 for order of 3. I believe its like $36 now before tax. | La Mercerie, Dominique Ansel, LA Burdick, Brigadeiro | Blue Ribbon has sneaky good dessert. Highly suggest the chocolate bruno | Salswee | Their white chocolate pistachio cookie is the best tasting cookie I’ve ever had in my LIFE. Chocolate chip cookie is also solid. Everything else is very good but pricey and might not be worth it. | Laduree | 1000% back this. Which is funny because people will say Librae and La Cabra are overhyped but I found the payoff from those lines worth way more than anything I had at Sweet Rehab. | Thanks! Can you get the almond cake to go from the bakery? | How expensive exactly do you know? I can’t find prices anywhere lol | I think so. Maybe call and ask just in case. | $16+. It doesn’t post prices because its target customer doesn’t care about prices.

I read some reviews, you’re forced to order Champagne to sit inside.

Mandoo Bar substitute needed,"I used to love going to Mandoo Bar (2 West 32nd) before it closed in 2020.  It was small and informal and great for lunch.

I'm craving a similar experience nearby.  

Any recommendations? ","Mandoo Bar is missed SO MUCH! There really isn't a single replacement restaurant that's as convenient or accessible.

Obviously not Korean, but you can still watch them make fresh dumplings and they're consistently excellent. | Yeah, I have fond memories of going there from childhood, because my dad used to work right next to the ESB.

Kinda funny but their pad thai before they changed the recipe was the best I've ever had, still. I dearly miss their dumplings.

There's some great dumpling spots out in Flushing but nothing really like that in Manhattan. There's some good Chinese dumpling spots of course; I've found Super Taste's dumplings taste closer to Korean ones than typical Chinese ones. | thank you! | Ahhhh I miss that place too!

Open Itinerary: Travelling from Chicago for a last-minute birthday trip!,"Hi there!

My boyfriend (32M) and I (soon to be 31F) booked some last-minute flights to NY for my birthday and are trying to figure out a rough itinerary. I've been to NY once before for a bachelorette and it's my boyfriend's first time so we are a little lost :').

We want to pick a hotel that is pretty central to some popular neighborhoods and very comfortable taking the subway. For food, we are definitely going to check out some handroll bars, but requesting suggestions for local favorites! 



TL;DR We would love recommendations for stay, activities, and especially food for some out-of-towners from Chicago that need a semi-laid back itinerary. 

  
Thank you so muchhhhhh","Stay in/around Times Sq, it's basically central to everything in terms of subway, and iirc it's apparently on the less expensive side (I dono, I don't stay in hotels here).   Sure it's touristy as fuck, but you don't have to do anything there other than hop on a train and sleep. If you can find something cheaper/more in your price bracket in LIC that might work (just really plot out how far you are from the train, and how long it'll take to get into Manhattan, it seems to be popular w/ tourists).

There are thousands of excellent restaurants in NYC, so you have to narrow it down a lot.

How much would you like to spend? Real dollar amounts.  Include a range if you have one (ie: you want one splurge meal that is $X/PP, would like to keep lunch around $Y/PP, diners at $Z/PP etc).  Alternatively how long are you hear for and how much have you budgeted for food?

What do you/don't you eat? What are you explicitly looking for, what can you not get in Chicago that you'd like to get here?

Where do y'all want to be?  Staying in Manhattan? Want to explore food friendly areas of Queens? Hip areas of Brooklyn? Do you have any explicit activities you want to do and need food around (eg: AMNH is awesome and is a real rival for the Field Museum)

Are y'all drinking? How much do you want to spend on that? What do you like?

My stupid food wanderings today were:

* TabeTomo - My favorite bowl of ramen in the city, recently reopened after a fire above them shut them down for a few months.  Tonkotsu Tsukemen with amazing flavor.
* Hekate - an adorable NA bar/coffee shop that I love stopping at for a flavored coffee and someplace to sit and digest.
* Carnitas Ramirez - The best carnitas I've ever had, featuring basically every part of the pig that they can legally sell (snout is shockingly good).  Surtida (little bit of everything) is the 'correct' choice if you're having just one, but after that pick out your favorite cuts (I think the cheek and tongue are particularly amazing). | Nami nori"

Upper West Side Vibey Food Spot Recommendation,Making my first visit to New York and me and my friends are looking for food spot on the upper west side of Manhattan that has a nice chill vibe and good food. Any recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you,"Disclaimer: I live on the UWS and for me a lot of the restaurants I like are more low key neighbourhoody places that you can kind of just walk in on a random evening. A couple of these below fit that general bill but some of these like Jacob’s Pickle or RedFarm I have had to be turned away/ 1-2 hour wait because I didn’t book a table in advance. So if you end up going to any of these I always recommend checking to see if they have reservations since it never hurts to have one especially on a weekend night in NYC.
Yes, the last couple of restaurants are chains but to be honest I prefer a lot of them than a lot of trendy instagrammy places where the food is just simply disappointing. Just my two cents. Good luck and hope you have lots of fun on your visit!

It was hard to narrow down the list of places to take him, but our goal was to show him some of our favorite spots or take him to restaurants that serve cuisine he would not normally get to eat in Brazil (e.g., persian, dim sum).

Short sentence and accompanying pic for each place attached to this post but happy to answer any specific questions folks may have about the places we tried.

- Antica Pizzeria Da Michele: went here after we tried and failed to get a walk in appointment for Una (smh). Very solid pizza, great service, and great value prop
- Baretto at Fasano: drinks after Pizza, had an amazing table right in front of the performers. Bit on the pricier side, but the show was good and it is a very civilized Jazz experience (i.e., you have space to move)
- Birthday Cake from Brigadeiro Bakery: most traditional Brazilian chocolate cake in the city…brought me back straight to my childhood.
- I Sodi: for birthday lunch. Our favorite restaurant in the city esp. since we have a personal connection to Tuscan food. We’ve been dreaming of the risotto verde ever since we tried it on the menu 3 yrs. ago and were so happy/surprised to see it back on the menu. Just an amazing, slow, festive sunday lunch. My favorite people at my favorite place.
- Din Tai Fung: brought dad for dim sum and XLB since he can’t really get it where he is from. Great service, fun vibes, good food. Sheet size of this restaurant never seizes to amaze me
- Eyval: one of our favorite places in the city. Tried some different things this time around - very fun, casual, relaxed vibes with good food. Dad LOVED it.
- Blue Hill at Stone Barns (two pics): what an amazing treat. My dad took us here for a birthday celebration. From the moment we walked in they made our group feel special. I don’t have enough words to describe how amazing this experience was. It was INSANELY expensive though - definitely reserve this for very special celebrations
- Oyster Bar: holds an emotional place in my dad’s heart. Good oysters, good shrimp cocktail, old school vibes
- Bar Orai: my favorite bar in the city, great music, neat ambiance, and a good selection of japanese whisky. Food is good too - on the pricier side
- Yopparai: fun and very authentic izakaya. Super tiny location, but the service is top notch and the food was very good/different from japanese food you can get in Brazil
- Via Carota: last stop before dropping dad at the airport. Still prefer the simplicity of I Sodi versus Via Carota, but their vegetables/salads were amazing

Not shown: the meals we ate at home, the random hot dogs we consumed in the street, and the far too many beers drank.

Finally, just a quick note: I recognize a lot of these restaurants are on the pricier side and to be able to go to so many of them in sequence is a privilege. I finally feel like I’m at a point in my life where I’m able to treat my dad to so many of these meals, which made it extra special. Similarly, him doing the same for me/my wife was equally as special. 2024 was a milestone year for us, and this felt like an extended celebration. Happy to answer any questions folks may have!","Hey just wanted to say this was a rough week and this post was a lovely thing to come across. One of the better versions of this kind of thing and a lovely tribute to your relationship with your dad. | What you did was proper and excellent | Bar Orai has been our list for a while. We used to go to Tomi Jazz before it became a TikTok nightmare, and it seems BO could fill that spot, even if it’s fancier. | Ooooh is that Ravagh? | Yopparai is wonderful! | I have saved this post, because I will definitely be referencing to it while exploring the city with my family on special occasions. It may take me a year for what you accomplished in a week. 

dê abraços ao seu pai. Meu tio mora no Brasil e você me lembrou se ele. | I saw this jazz band at Django last Friday! | Type of rich shit am I looking at the fuck of course you did great what type of fucking shit if the like if it’s above $100 you’re already living fine this is amazing | Thank you so much for your note. It was such a special week and I’m sure we’re all going to cherish these memories for a long time ☺️ | Thank you! Delicious food with amazing people! | Tell me about it…the one thing about Bar Orai is that, as far as I know it, does not have live music. But they have a pretty extensive record collection and bring outside DJs to curate playlist for the night | I highly recommend it though! | Eyval! | First time going there! We loved it! | I’m glad this can serve as a reference guide…e muito obrigado. Espero que seu tio esteja bem! | So good right? |  Thanks! Looks like we should check out Baretto, too. | Oh wow I can’t read lol. Ravagh is also really good if you haven’t been | He is doing ok. He loves nature But can’t take long walk like before. Ele tem noventa e dois anos e a última vez que visitou os EUA foi em 2001. Ele mora em Bento Gonçalves com sua família. | Highly recommend it - their caipirinha is very good | We’ve only ever had takeout from there but need to definitely go in person!! | Somos do rio grande do sul também…que bom saber que ele tem a familia perto ♥️ | Those takeout boxes they give away tho? Incredibly useful. I think I still have a few of them a few years later hahah | Every takeout box in my kitchen is from Ravagh."
Tomi Jazz on a saturday,Im trying to bring a date there this Saturday was told there's a 2-hour wait period. Do I have to wait in line or can I put my name down and come back?,
7 Train Food Tour Pescatarian Suggestions,"All I want for our 17th anniversary is a 7 Train food tour. 

We are driving in late Friday night and leave Sunday afternoon.  

Thinking about staying at Boro Hotel. Any other suggestions for accommodations welcome. 

The must stops we have right now are Temple Canteen, New World Market, and the Louis Armstrong Museum + Mariscos el submarino. 

Husband is vegetarian, I am pescatarian. I am willing to ease up on that for lamb or goat - husband is less likely to. Any must stop places and do not miss dishes? Thank you!","8 min walk to Queensboro Plaza ain't bad for a hotel.

How much do y'all want to spend? Real dollar amounts? Are you drinking?

I'm going to mainly stick to vegetarian (I'm an omnivore who doesn't eat fish, go figure), but here are some of my favorites along the 7 train:

* HEYTEA - It's one of the cool bubble tea places atm, good for fruit teas.  I've had the grape slush once, was really good, but ruined by a paper straw, so ask if they have plastic ones or at least compostable non-paper ones.
* Adda - super spicy Indian restaurant that's part of the current 'cool' Indian restaurant group.  Stick to the small vegetarian dishes, I think they far outshine the proteins.   Don't miss the dal or saag.
* Doughnut Plant - I dono, it's my favorite doughnut in NYC (Chocolate Sourdoughnut, happens to be vegan), fruit flavors are what got them first famous, but people tend to rave about the sourdough (me) or tres leches (also great).
* Bolivian Llama Party - Great Bolivian influenced sandwiches and bowls.  The vegetarian options are honestly amazing (even if I always get brisket or fried chicken), and they have vegetarian saltenas (Like a soupy empanada, I don't like them but 100% try them).
* Zhego or The Weekender for Bhutanese - I've only been to Zhego (And I love it), but have heard good things about The Weekender.  Lots of vegetarian options.
* Momo Crave - Tibetan style dumplings (they have a great veg filling) done up like other dishes.  Chilie and Sandeko are not to be missed (my favorite is sukuti, but that's a dried beef jerky), tandori is cute and good, chat is lovely, I'm not a fan of taco.  Other Nepali options also available.
* Angel - similar offerings to Adda (supposedly a former Adda cook) w/ well marked veg options.
* The Bengali food trucks - Look up Fuskahouse_NYC for Fuska.
* Dosa Delight - if you want more veg friendly dosas/south Indian food/Indo Chinese food.
* Khao Nom for Thai desserts (one of my favorite places)
* Temple Canteen - do pay attention to how long it will take to get to here, it's a long walk or a decent bus trip from the end of the 7, but I love it to bits.

Some random extras in Manhattan:

* [Overthrow Hospitality](https://www.overthrowhospitality.com/) - If you'd like a 'nice' place for you actual anniversary dinner they'll have a vegan restaurant that matches your vibe.
* Spicy Moon - Vegan Szechuan, couple of locations.
* Hangawi and their sister restaurant Franchia Vegan Cafe - Vegan Korean, basically the same food but Hangawi is in more 'traditional' settings (faux kneeling tables, take your shoes off at the door) while Franchia is more 'modern'.  Would be another nice idea for actual anniversary dinner.
* TabeTomo and Nakamura make great vegetarian ramen.
* May Kaidee - Vegan Thai (while Thai is easy to do for pescetarian, not particularly easy for a vegetarian).
* JaJaJa - Vegan Mexican that's popular (too much faux meat for my taste).
* The Original Buddha Bodai Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant, Bodhi Kosher Vegetarian Restaurant (no relation) and Vegetarian Dim Sum House for vegetarian Chinese in the heart of Chinatown (I love The Original Buddha Bodai and Veg Dimsum House, haven't been to Bodhi). | Thank you! This is a great list."
What to order at l’appartement 4F? ,What is the best item?,"Honestly, I think the raspberry KA is probably the tastiest thing I had because it was hot and fresh. 




BUT, big caveat, it is not, by any stretch of imagination and actual Kouign-amann—more of a differently shaped croissant? No caramelization, no crispness, and not sure what it'll taste like if not hot. 




I found everything else I tried (cinnamon bun, raspberry almond croissant) to be the definition of mid and overhyped to the extreme.  | The plain croissant is decent but this place is very overhyped | None of their sweet pastries are exceptional imo, almond croissant is solid.  

The ham and cheese and everything croissant are ok, imo their baguettes and sandwiches are the best products. | their stuff suck | The sourdough loaf. Place is pretty meh | Whatever you eat there is going to leave your mouth feel like it was coated in butter. | The tahini chocolate chip cookies. | The raspberry almond croissant or the rose pistachio croissant!! | I liked the Everything Croissant when I had it. I'm not sure it was worth going out of my way for. Definitely a decent spot if you're already in the neighborhood, though. | I like the ham and cheese | agreed their KA is definitely different! It's much more dough-y/bread-like and less flaky/laminated than others. I think the twice-baked croissants are a little greasy (all the butter!!) but I like their normal croissants, ham and cheese croissants, and focaccia a lot!"
"Looking for Trendy, Overhyped Garbage","My wife, who's in art school, has an assignment to do something she'd usually avoid – so I thought, what better than trying to find the trendiest, most influencer-hyped garbage meal in NYC? 

  
We're looking for any spots that check these boxes:

* Ridiculously long lines
* Wildly Instagrammable presentation
* A disappointing payoff where the flavors just don’t match the hype

Basically, we’re aiming for an unforgettable “only-in-NYC” experience where the vibe is the selling point, not the food. The goal is to experience that unique blend of NYC FOMO and buyer's remorse in one go.

  
Thanks in advance for helping us suffer!","Lafayette Bakery. Get ready to wait in a 2hr line for a mediocre round croissant served twice a day. | does Salt Bae still exist? | Sushidelic? | Crumbl in the west village. | jacks wife freda | Rolf's | The Bucher’s Daughter. Instagramable, full of tedious people. | Bad Roman! | Bubby’s.. I’m always shocked to see a line there.. Especially on bad weather days.  | magic hour rooftop bar | 12 Chairs 9 o’clock Saturday night | Have you tried Crumbl ? | * Wait on the line for Katz, then go to the one in Dekalb Market (or better, get food from Dekalb then eat it on the line at the original).
* Bad Roman - one of this sub's favorite places to shit on.
* Frog Club - Holy Fuck, but honestly they're already passe.
* Crumbl - Again, this sub looooves to shit on it. (this is probably the best suggestion I have)
* Salt & Straw on a Friday night - They actually move the line really quick, but the ice cream is just 'fine' (I think the sorbets are probably the best thing).  The UWS is great for dog watching though. | Forget the other comments, you want: Cathedrale, magic hour rooftop bar/lounge, beauty and Essex | Serendipity | The OG of terrible restaurants. Mr Chow.   

Horrific service. Atrocious food. Insane prices. Literally nothing good about it except how spectacularly bad it is. The Times even has a particularly scathing 0 star review slamming it. 

There are two locations. One on the upper east side and one in tribeca. I’ve only had the terrible misfortune of going to the one on the upper east, so go there is you want a truly terrible dinner. 

Only thing is that it may not totally meet your parameters. It is kind of a draw for tourists and a certain scene (I’m told art people and media people—but I can’t confirm) and you might see a few influencers there. But it’s not going to be like a Carbone or something where there is going to be a line of jackasses with selfie sticks. Maybe one or two though.  | Ellen’s Stardust diner, not necessarily Instagram trendy, but definitely tourist trap lol | Times Square Olive Garden has become overrun by locals and influencers. The food never disappoints though. | Fellini. Very mid, very hyped, and currently getting trashed over bad food prep (warm refrigerators, food sitting atop trash cans). | Carbone. Most places in meat packing. | Crumbl  | Anything Caity Weaver reviewed in her incredible comedy series for gawker. Options include the restaurant in the American girl store, the one in Tommy bahama (see below) and many more.

If you want the experience, Mr Chow is the place to go. Your girlfriend will probably appreciate the historic connections to the art world too. The food is good as well, just overpriced. | Surprised I haven’t seen COCODAQ mentioned yet | Carbone? | Scarr’s Pizza | The original [Catch NYC](https://www.catchrestaurants.com/location/catch-nyc/)

Google their donut wheel | Corner store | Dirty French. Full of out of town influencers. The food is like fucking a corpse and calling french because you used a baguette. | Wait for thanksgiving holiday pies. You can get a pumpkin pie for $55 at your local gentrified bakery shop. | Black Tap | Jacks Wife Frieda | Brown Bag Sandwhiches | Salt Bae lol | lil sweet treat or le Bon Bon. Great candy that you can mostly find elsewhere. | Rolf's during holiday season definitely fits the bill,. Be prepared. They have a one drink minimum and the one time I went drinks were 30$, and they didn't' list the price. | spot dessert bar in flushing. It taste horrible and only looks pretty. Tours les jours next day is way better. They also add a mandatory 20% gratuity :/ when u spend over a certain amount | Datz Deli. Over priced beef patty with oxtail | Anywhere those two girls on Instagram that have voices that make you wish you were deaf, say to go | Shocked I haven’t seen Tao mentioned yet. If you want to have dinner with oppressively loud music, surrounded by 30 women in the same beige dress posing between tables while their boyfriends struggle to take their picture, it’s dinner and a show! | Citizens of Chelsea  | Carbone. No question. | Sugar factory? | Magnolia Bakery. Their baked goods are fine, the banana pudding is offensive. You could right now make the recipe from the Nilla Wafers box and it would be better than Magnolia and with 100% less poorly made whipped cream. | Levain Bakery | What’s that AYCE omakase spot? It blew up on TikTok earlier this year but I’ve heard it’s trash. Souraji I think? | Kora | Sushidelic! | Cocodaq .. | Bad Roman | Dirty French a decade ago. | Jue Lan Club several years ago lol overpriced garbage. Never had a more disappointing meal in my life | Rolf's does suck. 

Lafayette comes to mind, but I've never had that croissant, but I doubt it's that good. Dominique ansel is usually not worth the trouble, but it's a good bakery on average. They make a mean cookie when it's served warm, but they make no attempt to serve warm ones.

Via Corrata is WAY overrated. Carbone is fine, but I've only been twice.

Katz fucking rocks.

Hometown barbecue has a line out the door, but serves banging barbecue. Just to put in a good word. Also... Better pastrami sandwich than Katz. Boom! | Halal guys, I am gonna get a lot of hate for this but it’s true | Mamas Too weekly sandwich special | Carbone | Crumbl cookies | 230 Fifth. | Most of the food vendors at the USQ holiday market but especially that hot chocolate crap | surprised no one has mentioned arthur and son’s. their sauce might be from a jar… | Dante | Joe's pizza Broadway | Saint Theo's. The TikTok wannabe scene and overpriced extremely mid food will do the trick. | COQADAQ | Lucia pizza on canal and broadway. Always a line, but happier grocery right door has better pizza | The milkshakes at Black Tap Craft Burgers and Beer were so unbelievably disappointing, disgusting, overpriced and when I went years ago it had the classic annoying NY long line | Prince Street Pizza and Bungalow | Just go research on Tik tok | PopUp Bagels. I'm biased because I think bagels as a carb is mid and would never wait in line for it period. | Dominique Ansel's Cronut. Serendipity | Carbone or Polo Bar | Balthazar or Carbone checks all these boxes. | Bad Roman, Pop Up Bagels, Crumbl Cookies, Radio Bakery (honestly anything in Brooklyn), Leon's Bagels, Carbone, and that coffee shop in midtown that makes ""Tiramisu"" lattes. whew i can go on. | Theodora in bk. The timing of the line alone will do it for ya.  | Breakfast by Salt’s Cure 


Yes that’s the name of it. I don’t understand it. There is always a line 50 people deep up the street to get the most mid, greasy breakfast you’ve ever seen.


Bowery Bar.

I don’t know if they’re college kids but again lines twice as long as the places capacity for a bar with no personality.

Brown Bag sandwich Co.

It’s a 2 hour line to get your hands on an average bodega chopped sandwich. 

Via Carrota / I Sodi

vibe is ok but the food is so, so bland! So overhyped. And it’s like you’re not allowed to say it.

Popup Bagels.

Massive line for Average bagels with bellow average service. No sandwiches. You can only buy bagels in bulk (min 3)  and the only accompaniment is an entire packet of salmon and a giant tub of schmere (both over 10 bucks). They don’t even slice the bagels. So you have to buy a big tub of schmere and go in the park and try to tear and dip the bagels in it. Looks and tastes sad. | L’Industrie Pizza WV location, bubbys in TriBeca, Via Carota | For breakfast, go to Flippers in SoHo | Don Angie | Somtum Der is so hipster hyped but we find it underwhelming and the service surly. 

[https://www.somtumdernewyork.com/](https://www.somtumdernewyork.com/) | Adels halal cart but 10000000000% worth the hype | Katz's wins because yesterday, literally the line was all the way around the block.  I don't eat that shit any more but can you had to laugh at all the chumps in line. | Villabate Alba | Caffè Panna. And when you leave, can you please take the line with you? Thanks. | Nowon | So true.  And don't forget the croissant is ten mother fuckin dollars. | I don't get the hate, go midday no line

It was really good every time I've gotten it | This is the one | Thanks! I used to live near here and always wondered if it was good, but never went because I bake a lot myself | This was my first thought | I think there’s still one on 6th & 52nd | there’s no lines though it’s always empty other than the 2 tables of arabs | there’s one at the four seasons in Dubai if you’re headed that way | OMG YES | I was gonna say this! Hear it’s crap | Crumbl anywhere. The lines in the UES and UWS are hilarious cause it’s literally only high school kids | I truly don’t understand the hype. Maybe it’s because I grew up with Insomnia Cookies upstate, but Crumbl is straight garbage. I had a friend that was a manager there for a short time and would bring us boxes at the end of her shift and they’re just…. Not good. | nah that place is almost perfectly mediocre. It needs to be someplace worse | I must be missing something. I've been there twice by chance, once very late for drinks after a show and once at about 4 for a boozy late lunch/snack. Both times it was empty and seemed very pleasant. Did I miss a lot of hype somewhere? | Fully mid. 

Every time I’ve ever gone. | A million times, this. | I’ve been to the one on 8th Ave. it’s ok at best | And why tf does Jack have his name on the restaurant? Shouldn’t it just be Freda’s? | Bonus points: Rolf's at Christmas. | Oh but I actually love going to the one in Williamsburg for brunch. You can always get a table and it’s nice if you’re not a bacon and eggs type of person. | First time I ordered. Bomb.  Second time old salad terrible quality terrible taste. | I had to go there and based on this sub expected it to be a) insanely expensive and b) ridiculously bad and it was just meh on both fronts. I’ve had a a lot worse | lol i’ve enjoyed it all 3 times i’ve gone. i’m prepared for downvotes but as far as overhyped places go the food is still good. and if you avoid the marketing traps it’s not that expensive. but probably still overrated compared to how the influencers treated it. | Was coming here to comment this. The chicken scarp pasta was the saltiest meal I've ever had I my life. I'm convinced they dropped a carafe of salt into my dish. But overall sooo meh and pricey | Absolutely the worst meal I have ever had. Shockingly terrible and crazy $$$ | I was there just because I couldn't reasonably say jo to the person that proposed we go there...my god it was fucking garbage. | I live around the corner from bubby's. I think it is the best American brunch in NYC. But I can't believe the line and staying power of this place . | If you have epilepsy this place will really fuck yoh up | no line tho | I went to the one in Williamsburg a year ago and it was truly one of the most hilariously bad dining experiences I've had in my 8 years in NY. It's insane how bad it was. | Katz is not overhyped. | Frog Club giving up and letting people take pictures was so funny. That hype must have died down real quick. | People are in NYC of all places waiting in line for Crumbl? They’re all over Northern Colorado and you can pop into any location and be out in a couple of minutes with cookies. They aren’t even that good without a wait time. | Salt and straw is good!! But I’m from the west coast so haven’t ever stood in a crazy line for it | I wouldn’t wait in line for crumbl even as a bit | Salt and Straw is great. An actual west coast gem blessing the shitty ice cream scene of NYC | salt and straw’s ice cream is so cloying and heavy | I had a good brunch at Bad Roman.... | Crumbl is good F NY for that opinion lol | Cathedrale is actually not bad though | B&E is such hot tourist garbage | Cathedrals is such a shitty scene but their milkbread needs to be injected directly into me | All run by the tao group | Aren’t they closed ? | He said garbage, not world class meal | That location has to be the best decision Olive Garden ever made. Has to make a killing and is the most effective billboard they could ever have. | Carbone has its issues, but the food is undeniably good | Caity Weaver inspired me to get a coconut cloud martini and she was on the fuckin money | OP u/dumaas this is it. Coqodaq is incredibly mid Korean fried chicken, but the salesmanship borderlines pomposity. Like. “OF COURSE you should get a champagne pairing and the $27 nugget! 🙄”

I did not enjoy the food. But I enjoyed the overhyped brazenness of it all. Best part: you can limit the damage $$ if you’re smart bout it.

Bad Roman, though wildly overhyped, is at least decent food tbh. | 100% the nugget is never worth it. It genuinely tastes like a badly made McDonald’s chicken nugget but saltier. But while I enjoyed their bucket meal you can get chicken with similar crunch at like Seoul Salon | I came here to say this | Expensive but the food is good. Hell the free thing of cured meat, motz in olive oil and toasted bread is a legitimatly perfect bite. 

It's a victim of its success, but it's gonna be hard to walk away from that meal and say it was bad. You don't hear anyone talk shit about Parm. | Was just at carbone. $95 for veal parm is crazy but can’t deny that it’s a huge portion and delicious. Pastas are also good and service is impeccable. Sorry haters it’s an actually good restaurant lol | They are extremely inconsistent. Some days, their pizza is really special. Other days it’s any other slice shop.  | They purposefully move slowly to keep the line long. It’s bananas  | Insanely wrong take | Then…don’t get the donut wheel? That’s a dessert for a large table. Not a main menu item.

Catch is solid and way better than it needs to be for a nightlife restaurant. | It’s been a few years since I went, but I thought they were capable. Expensive for what you get and I’m not compelled to return, but I didn’t think it was bad.  | This makes me want to eat there | $1million dollars per pound but it’s decent candy haha. Just overpriced | Does this place have hype? I consider it just alright, but a convenient place to go near me without waiting in a long line. Most trendy, overhyped places I can’t walk into with a 10-15 minute wait. | This is an insane answer to me. Nothing place | What? I love them. There’s only a line on weekends, the food is ok, unlike crumbl which is yucky and has a line every day. And is a national chain. | No one actually thinks Sugar Factory is cool or trendy, though. It's a place to take your middle schooler for their birthday party while the parents get drunk. | Their lemon cookie is good. (I have never waited on line there—might have different opinion if I did) | Yes, Souraji in Chelsea. It used to be called Mojo Onakase | I have no idea why the nytimes hyped bungalow up so much | Bagels are among the best bread product available in America | Bruh, I'd like to see you eat a cronut and tell me it was trash. Dominique Ansel is hyped up but it's actually good. | Serendipity I might agree with. Each time I’ve been there’s an absurd wait, and the frozen hot chocolate was good but idk if it’s worth all that. | Balthazar is an absolute institution. Firmly the best brasserie in the city. 

And you rarely have to wait in much of a line if you sit at the bar. | Radio bakery is great but I've only been on weekdays and walked straight up to the counter. Dismissing all bakeries in Brooklyn is insanely stupid. | You get via carota’s name out your mouth | L'industrie is overrated, but getting their pizza while going to Talea is my favorite date. | L’Industrie is great, though some slices are notably better than others | Katz is good. You're bugging. | Not garbage but 100% overhyped | Nah, don’t worry, Insomnia is also garbage. Maybe slightly better than Crumbl but the bar is down in hell. | All their cookies seem to be different though, with different cookie doughs and even icings/toppings vary so I feel like there’s something for everyone | Ya it’s like an overpriced diner. If only that was as bad as it gets | I lived down the block for awhile from the Williamsburg one and I know I’ve eaten there, but I literally can’t even remember what I ate, how it was, etc. it’s like a blank period of “mediocre” in my head | yea it’s a brunch thing | It's named after their grandparents. | I have never even seen a picture or video that makes that nasty ass food look remotely good. | i like it too | Yeah I had a decent time | Thank youuuuu. I’m all for finding hidden gems but Katz is popular and for good reason | Respectfully disagree. They are legit good. No question. But worth that crazy ass like? No way! | They are awful cookies. Just taste of sugar and they are also in suburban strip malls all over the tri state so not sure why anyone is waiting in line | If you ever walk closely by the line and listen in you figure out it's mostly foreigners here on vacay trying out the tiktok famous cookie place | Its like Raisin Canes here. They are all over the place. However, what you need to understand about NYC is that it attracts FOREIGN tourists and not North American. A lot of the people standing in lines for chain restaurants are trying things they wouldn't be able to in their home country and their trip to the U.S. mostly is in NYC. | The one by Hunter has a reliably long line every day around high school dismissal time. For reasons you can probably imagine. | Crumbl is trash | Also the lines will eventually die down when it's not new anymore. | It’s also a chain that’s not just in nyc | I said this to someone the other day-cookie technology has peaked, a while ago now. There’s nothing new anyone’s gonna with a cookie that hasn’t already been done so waiting on line for one seems actually dumb to me. I’ll give an exception to Levain 25 years ago. | Honey Lavender is my favorite because of how light it is | It’s a middle of the road cookie. So many better options | I went here for a corporate event and the food was some of the best I’ve had. | I walked by on a weeknight at 8 PM last month and the line was down the full block and around the corner. | Google says they’re open? Idk I usually avoid that general area lol | Yup but it fits the bill of a sceney instagram place | As did I. | Carbine has went from overhyped to overhated | I think you're just not realizing that their small pizza is much worse than their large. Also... This place isn't so special if you're willing to eat pork pepperoni. | When is the time to go? Cuz midnight ain’t it | Mostly on social media like Instagram. And there’s long wait times during peak hours. | (Can confirm) | Their baked goods are overly sweet | Cronut and DA's stuff are legit | I have been. Was first in line and got the first month's batch way back in the day (the original rose flavor). Went back once since. Greasy, flavorless, cold, and disappointing. Same with the DKA. I've had much better kouign amanns than that. The canele was decent though. | no one is ""dismissing"" them but they're absolutely over rated and at the end of the day you're having a pastry filled with either meat, cheese or something. Not exactly ground breaking stuff the justifies lines and Tik Tok reviews | I don’t eat meat.  I don’t wait in line.  But you do you. | Yeah I was being provocative but imo one of the most overrated places currently and many of my friends agree | Ah. Got it.  | Their grandparents’ name was Jack’s Wife Freda? | The presentation is in the room. The plates look like something from a hospital cafeteria in 1960. | I’ve eaten there. It was atrocious.  | I've eaten there while decorated , it was fun and the snitzchel was fine. You go there for the ambiance and to be with friends, and it accomplished that. | Knocking the line is fair, but their food is fucking great | The line has never been that bad nothing more than 30 minutes for me and in July at like Tuesday at 11 there’s no line at all (maybe Wednesday or Thursday). Love it. | Do yall have a Dirty Dough? Similar concept except the cookies are stuffed. Now those are cookies waiting in line for. | I assume it’s all tourists | Yeah, I had one in Philly before they came here. Thought it was perfectly adequate. Definitely wouldn't wait in line. | i moved here from iowa last year and we had one back home lol | These are also bad cookies | Like what? | Oh I’m aware. Went there and got one of their small pizzas. 100% unremarkable. Will never do that again.

I think they have an A team and a B Team. If you come when the right crew is working and you come in for a slice, the pizza is great. Cracker thin, crisp crust. Good sauce to cheese ratio. Totally on point. 

But if the B team is there, you may as well be going to any other slice shop.  | > When is the time to go?

never ? | Well of course a cronut is gonna be greasy since it's got the composition of a croissant and is probably like 30% butter. Definitely wasn't cold and flavorless when I went though. I started going when the hype wasn't so crazy and there weren't very long lines so maybe you were just unlucky and didn't get it as fresh as mine. Or it's not for you 🤷 | You literally said everything in Brooklyn so yeah you were dismissing everything in Brooklyn. Every single bakery in Brooklyn is that? Wait are you just saying baked goods in general are overhyped? | Omg, still? That’s how they looked 40 years ago | Oh, it's decorated like that year round. Whenever I walk by, I think about the poor sap who has to dust all of that, and all the filthy hidden places that can't be dusted because of it. | Sarge’s and 2nd Avenue’s pastrami is all just as good. Mile’s end is even better. None of them have lines. 

Any other pastrami focused Jewish Deli can do what they do, without the absurd line, high prices and annoying ticket system.  | Levain Bakery, Dominique Ansel, Chip City, Insomnia Cookies, Schmackary's... And that's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more that I can't think of right now. | You seem very upset for someone who I can bet isn't even a native Brooklynite. 

Does Brooklyn have gems? sure but Brooklyn has been stripped and gentrified to a point that even the gentrifiers who pushed out the minorties are struggling to afford it. The suburb-fication of Brooklyn has been to cater to that crowd and in come in the very over rated and over priced restaurants and bakeries that quite honestly aren't that impressive but because they're in a ""cool"" neighborhood and have a niche following people convince themselves it's something spectacular. 

It's my opinion as a native NY and I'm entitled to it as much you're entitled to yours. | 2nd ave deli! Pastrami is great, pea soup too | Sarges is alright jr their pastrami isn’t as good as Katz’s. 2nd ave a bit closer but still not the same | Insomnia no way. Chip city is amazing though agreed | Why would your status as a native new yorker have any bearing on your opinions of bakeries? That person also didn’t seem “upset” at all | That's way more fair and clear that whatever tf you were trying to say before 😅.

I agree with you I just had no idea what you were saying."
Mid-High end Sushi in NYC: Amane vs Yasuda,"I'm visiting NYC in a couple of weeks and am currently sitting on Omakase bookings at Sushi Amane and Sushi Yasuda.

I love Sushi but rarely try the higher end stuff, but I don't often travel alone and get the opportunity to sit down and just enjoy the food.

Right now my estimates: Yasuda will cost about $300 - $400 (incl Sake / wine) and Amane will cost about $550 (fixed cost of omakase + seasonal wine pairing)

Any thoughts about which one I should go for? From what I can read online, Amane is slightly better and the ambience is more to my liking (dimmer, more cosy) but they both have a michelin star and I imagine there isn't too much between then?","Amane is much better. But if you like the intimate ambiance, Takeda is better than both. | Haven’t been to either. My personal opinion is that for sushi, there’s a real diminishing effect with cost benefit as it gets up there in price. I’ve been to sushi nakazawa and enjoyed it - they have a star. But to be honest, loved Shiki Omakase Even more for a fraction of the cost. | Thanks, I’m going to go with Amane. Looking at prices, Takeda is quite reasonable so I may save that for a business meal where I need to show value for money a bit more!"
PSA: City Bakery is alive and well in Japan ,"Not sure if this post is allowed because technically not in NYC, but I time-traveled back to the time of City Bakery by going to a location in Osaka a few weeks ago!! I got the pretzel croissant and tbh it was pretty close to how I remember it. I miss those croissants (and the hot chocolate, and CB in general) so much and this was such a nice blast from the past 🥲🥲

Lots of locations across Japan including Tokyo and Kyoto too: https://thecitybakery.jp/","so funny how all of these defunct american chains (like Dean & Deluca and Tower Records) live on in Japan | Same with ""dean & deluca"" they are all over asia. | Do they have the hot chocolate? | Barney's, too.

During my last trip to Tokyo I saw a sign that said 'Florent' on a building but I didn't go inside to see what the deal was. | This makes me happy and sad at the same time | I miss that croissant!! 😭 | Is that the pretzel croissant? | I have traveled to Tokyo the past three summers (husbands work) and there’s a a City Bakery in the hotel we stay at. It makes me soooooo happy. 

There’s also, oddly enough, a Buttermilk Channel in Tokyo. That one caught me off guard. Lol | Oh my gosh! I worked on 18th Street for years and would get a pretzel croissant and hot chocolate once a week as a treat. More often during the month of hot chocolate. The bourbon one was so good. | Wake me up when Financier is opened back up 🥲 was a nice special birthday treat for me growing up | 😭 I miss this thing so much | I miss their oatmeal raisin cookies so much! | You need to check out the The City Bakery Kyoto Shijo Teramachi. It has to die for curry puffs and rice flour baguettes filled with green tea and hojicha cream filling. They are exclusive to Kyoto. | I think about City Bakery at least once a week.  | Eating their mac and cheese as a kid is probably my earliest culinary memory. Miss that place so much. | Wow, another reason to return to Japan | I remember going to a massive Gorilla Coffee in Tokyo. Though looks like it's closed now too. | As is Dean & Deluca lol

Also like a billion Americana heritage brands that don't exist here anymore | I am so jealous. Good for Japan. | Oh man have a brownie bottom for me! | Blast from the not so distant past! | Visiting Japan and did the same.  Go visit c Portland Bakery for their cream donut in Osaka.  Excellent. | Do they have the peanut butter drop cookies ? I miss those so much !!!! | OMG 😢🗽 | I loved their salad bar so much, they would get a lot of it at the US green market. | Super not helpful information. | Meanwhile 711 is garbagio in usa and convenience heaven in asia. We need consolidation. | Family Mart and Lawson's were both originally American chains as was Mr.Donut. | What's that expression? ""Japan has been living in 2000 since 1980""? | Hanon, the great udon place in Williamsburg that burned down, is opening there too | A dude from Thailand bought that brand drove it into the ground in the US (shockingly stupid decision making) and bugged out.  A real shame | The owner did a hot chocolate pop up last winter in the food hall near Grand Central. You should keep an eye out on if they do the same this year. | Yes! I didn't try it but the two locations I visited both had it [https://thecitybakery.jp/menu](https://thecitybakery.jp/menu) | They do! They were even doing a daily special hot chocolate over 1 week in February when we were there earlier this year. | I can ask Florent and confirm, but I’m pretty sure it’s not related. | such is the case with most things the older you get. is that what they call nostalgia? | Yes! I snapped the pic then wolfed it down haha | Yess that threw me even more than the Buvette 😂 | What hotel | Wait, what?? Where are we getting Buche de Noel? This is very upsetting news.

ETA: Oh, it happened during Covid when there was so much bad news, this one just slipped my mind. | Same! | Wait hold on hold on are the rice flour baguettes gluten free 😵‍💫 | The Mac and cheese and their fried chicken mmmm | We're going to Japan in March and all my kids want to do is visit 711. | 711s are also really good in Scandinavia | Costco food court has much better variety in other countries than the US ones. | Good news for you [this is kinda happening right now](https://youtu.be/RATHbP1bAhI?si=SkA8ZFbJqtTGCMeY) | How would consolidation help when American 7-11 is already owned by the Japanese? | i was waiting for 2 years for them to reopen 😭😭😭😭

they were so much better than raku lmfao | ugh i'm still so upset that it closed and they teased us with being ""temporarily closed"" for so many years | Really miss the original store on Broadway 😪 | On instagram his userbame is _colorofchocolate_ | I'm sure it's not related, I'm not sure if it was even a restaurant.  Here's a photo if you want to show him:

https://i.imgur.com/yWQnBhw.jpeg | I’m very jealous. It was of my favorite thing to eat there. | Buvette has been there!!! About five years at least | Prince Gallery.  It’s a fabulous hotel, imo. | Covid ended them I think. 😞 | I’m not 100% sure but I think they are | Do it a few times because it is awesome for sure, but make sure to take the time to actually do local stuff, not just the chain/social media bullshit | Definitely get the egg salad sandwich there! | There's this [delicious pancake sandwich](https://www.asseeninjapan.com/home/konbini-kinyoubi-pancake-sandwich-from-family-mart) they sell at the convenience stores there. Give it a try. | It's way better than US convenience store food but it's still shitty convenience store food. It's great for quick drinks and snacks but don't waste a meal there when there are so many great options a few blocks in any direction | I can taste the salty sesame crunch and the doughy inside just looking at this photo ughhh | I did this too much on my first trip part of me is upset by it but the other half really enjoyed it hard to find balance when you're only there for a short time at least for me personally | I think it makes more sense to limit it for shorter trips. I guess if it's your first time to E. Asia it's super novel but honestly it's really not that great imo compared to meals you could get for the same price from local shops. I'm Korean-American so I grew up with that basically my whole life going back and forth so it's whatever haha

But I always tell people to do the regular tourist circuit their first time in Japan for sure, KIX -> Osaka/Kyoto/Nara -> Tokyo -> NRT as well as hitting all the konbinis and the bullshit like Ichiran and Don Quijote and get it out of their system for the next trip to be more focused haha

Also at this point I refuse to fly over for less than three weeks, just not worth it imo | Getting even two weeks is difficult for me unfortunately I am aiming to make my second trip there weeks will try my best

I did that exact circuit you mentioned on my first trip,
I learned quickly don quixote has nothing special at least in my opinion so probably wouldn't go there again, did go to ichiran but probably wont in Japan since they have it in NYC now.

Might need to get a little more konbini out of my system tho but I'll do my best to try more local food, usually konbini was just my breakfast any other part of the day I'd eat somewhere else | I usually only eat konbini food late at night haha. I tend to eat like five to six meals per day when in Japan. Last time I was mostly focusing on ramen so I averaged two bowls per day on top of other meals | My partner gets full on like a single apple (exaggerating a bit) so tried to keep at her pace, I can't eat like I used to I do plan on trying to get a lot more physical activity to make myself more hungry"
Japanese Food Expo - 11/08 - 12pm @Japan Village,,"Would you mind reporting back what foods they have? I wasn't able to find a list or even a sample list of vendors online, nor photos from past years. | Here’s the list of vendors! https://jfe.japanfoodculture.org/ny | thank you!"
Places that can match Ivan Ramen's Chicken Paitan?,I had this ramen a while ago at Ivan Ramen and havent been anywhere else with quite the same effect. Does anyone have recommendations for good alternatives?,"Totto Ramen for chicken Paitan | Which other places have you had?

For chicken paitan, there’s Totto, Toribro, Marufuku, and Susuru Ramen. Favorite is Susuru’s.

Okiboru has a good pork and chicken paitan. | Marafuku!"
Recs for tandoori white fish?,Just ordered fish tikka in a restaurant recently and got some dry salmon. Now really craving for some good tandoori white fish but can't seem to find it by just searching. Bonus if they have fluffy naan too,Try angel Indian in Jackson heights
Is Double Chicken Please overrated?,"The other day I went to this famous restaurant/cocktail bar, and we ended up paying over $200 for 3 cocktails and a few bites… Was it good? Yes! Would I go again? Definitely not.","Do you mean 3 cocktails per person, so 6 total? There’s no way 3 individual cocktails+a couple of their bites ran you over $200. 

Honestly, considering it was ranked one of the best cocktail bars in the world I was surprised the cocktails weren’t $25-$30, instead all of their cocktails hover around $20. They’re only a few dollars more expensive than 100s of more average cocktail bars in the city. And DCP cocktails were all unique and memorable. The food was also fantastic.

So in my opinion, no I didn’t think it was overrated. You have to remember it’s still just food+drinks. It’s not going to change your life, but for small-ish premium I think it was worth it and would go again, albeit maybe more of a once a year thing. | Only place I’ve been to where 3 cocktails can cost you over $200 is Bacarrat lol | I don't know if I'd call it overrated, but I prob wouldn't go back either. The cocktails are very cool and unique, but it's tough to have more than one because the flavors are so strong. Ideally I'm glad I tried it, but I prefer to find cocktails that have more balance between uniqueness and drinkability... | All of these Instagram cocktail bars are the same. $20 drinks that are nothing special, in a hyped up place.  They’re for tourists.  They jack up the prices because people pay it.   It’s a splurge night. They likely do not have a ton of return customers. | Looking at their menu, cocktails are all around $20, so if they only got 3 then I think OP is being vague on what “a few” bites were. 

Is it overrated? Maybe? Sounds like OP didn’t like it but I’d say if you want a fancy cocktail, it’s worth trying. They have a solid reputation and their prices are pretty common in NYC these days. | That’s exactly what I meant!!! I’ve been to many of the 50 Best Bars in different cities, and not all of them are like that… | That's interesting because I'm starting to get the feeling that all the 50 best bars are like that!! 🤣 I'm wondering if to get on that list you have to be so innovative that the drinks are just crazy. Which would you say are not like that?"
lobster poutine ,shared this with a friend @ cull & pistol in chelsea market - most interesting and tasty lobster i've had since lydia shire's lobster pizza at biba in boston ,"And bring us the finest food you got stuffed with the second finest.

Excellent, sir...lobster stuffed with tacos. | All that’s missing is black truffle | Did the curds squeak? | These are disco fries with fully melted cheese, not poutine with cheese curds | Right up my alley, how much? | Where is that? So I know never to ever go there and see this terrible waste of a lobster. | That's not poutine | I love their Pistols on Horseback | the charred lemon is a cool touch | [r/StupidFood](https://www.reddit.com/r/StupidFood/) | Put the lobster on top of the routine please!  

Show some respect | i can imagine this being delicious | Food porn (derogatory) | Weird flex. | ""It's my number 1 favorite food stuffed with my number 3 favorite food"" | Lobster shell with miniature gummy bears and kebabs. | I still think about the Lobster and Black truffle Mac n cheese I had in an old restaurant in Portland ME. | Might as well toss on some gold leaf too | At Le Bernadin, there is a lobster roll on the lounge menu, lobster in a truffled bun. Unfortunately a bit expensive but I like it. | lil bit | Yes. 

It's funny how basic things can occasionally pass as alternative nonsense in NY. 

This is literally insane. Any other food product and people would be protesting. 

This is baked bagels. This is fake bbq. Both sell in NY. Size issues are the excuse for a tldr. 

The spot that sold this is pretty good. Its just clearly not a poutine. Don't call it a poutine. 

Call it fancy boy disco fries and be done with it. | listed @ MP - was $59 yesterday... i rarely buy/eat lobster... so, have no clue what market price is these days


enough food to split for sure. | Buy a kitchen torch. They're cheap and make so many things like that lemon super simple. And delicious.  

Miss a spot on a sear? Torch. Lemons? Torch. Made a whole roll of chashu and want to use it for your home made ramen? Torch. Creme brulee? Torch. Wanna make that apple pie little crunchy one top? Sugar and torch.   

I love my torch. Best $20 I think I spent for the kitchen. | This is a food snuff film. | fore street? i think they've had a lobster & truffle m&c in the past | It just looks like melted cheese??? | Seems about right! | > i rarely buy/eat lobster

Yeah, we figured. | Fore street is awesome"
What to eat in Time Out Market in DUMBO?,I live one subway away from here and haven’t had the chance to visit it. My friends is visiting this weekend and wanted to try some food here. Any reco? Thank you!,"Somewhat related: Has anyone else noticed that the food at Timeout is usually not as good as the original locations? I feel like it's often not as freshly prepared or misses the mark in some other way. It's understandable as the vendors are often dealing with a smaller kitchen setup etc but it's still kind of annoying as it's usually priced the same? 

It's geared towards tourists so I guess the business models works out in the end.. | Clinton street bakery pancakes and Jacob’s pickles | We just had an awesome pastrami sandwich and killer garlic fries at Pastrami Queen | Someone else would have to chime in to confirm, but bark BBQ looks amazing | Okiboru House of Tantan. Okiboru has other locations but their tantan ramen and tsukemen are exclusive to here.

Would also recommend Bark BBQ | Bark is delicious!!! | Nothing! None of it is very good lol, just go to the original locations of whatever interests you | Jacob’s pickles, Bark BBQ, and Chote Miya! That place is always crowded though. The pizza upstairs is also nice but nothing of note. I love sitting by the Ferris wheel (there’s some benches behind it) or the little garden area — the rooftop has never been lucky for me to find a spot :( | I like the Thai place it's pretty good and some of the ice creams the other store has there... | Clinton st bakery slaps also cha cha matcha | I mostly go for the pizzas in the top floor. The first floor (main area) also has a Mexican/Middle-eastern which is, not necessarily Mexican, but good. | Clinton St Bakery blueberry pancakes. The original location is too busy, it’s not worth it. Coffee comes with endless refills.  | It’s a tourist trap. I’d recommend just going to the original locations. | I really love pasta and sometimes when I have a bad day I go to Felice and order two of their spaghetti alla chitarra con pomodoro  🍝 | Jacob's Pickles! | There’s a burger place that my bf and I love. Yes, it’s pricey. Yes, there’s better burger joints, but you asked for a place at a particular location and I highly recommend this one! | I mean, you more or less just summed up food halls and why so many people find them convenient, if not mediocre | Oh I totally agree with you. I used to be excited about checking out food halls until I had that realization, so I don't go out of my way to go to them now. Only if I already happen to be close to one if I'm doing something else. | Because the vendors have to share an enormous portion of their profits with the market so they cut corners when they can. The market doesn’t make vendors pay rent but instead pay a very large portion of their profits without any limits. | This is a winner there if you want to just pick one place. | It’s expensive and usually has a line but it’s pretty good imo | Chicharron brisket sandwich is 💯 | Just had it the other day after hearing it's one of the best BBQ places in the city, and it was definitely the worst of the three places I've tried so far. The ribs were good, but the mac and cheese should be called mac and pepper, and the pulled pork was also wayyyy too salty/peppery. Both were actually kinda unpleasant to eat. Definitely nowhere near the level of Butcher Bar, or even Mighty Quinn's. | It’s mediocre. Tried it a few times and it’s just fine. Looks way better on social media. | Pizza on the top floor is defo the move. | Agree! That's why I haven't been there even if I live here. However, my friend is a tourist and wanted to visit, so I have to oblige. | generally true however i gotta say Ive really enjoyed my meals at Urban Hawker | I guess my point was that the distinction isn't painfully obvious to everyone. Or maybe I just live under a rock. E.g I had Jacob's pickles at timeout first and (unjustly?) disliked it for years until finally got around to trying it at the actual location. | Also they run out of the best things fairly early in the evening. | Damn that's too bad. I was mainly interested in the brisket but everything looked good. | Wait, what? You're saying social media presented an idealized version of something that's not reflected in real life? Really?? | yup urban hawker and food gallery 32 stand out | Urban hawker week 1 was on track to be life changing. Tried almost everything. When everyone went back to Singapore and local employees took over it has had the sharpest decline of any place in memory, some more than others. | Same as Wonder. Food by famous chefs but it seems like it's mediocre quality premade microwaved meals. | It was pretty good. Not great. And not great value | Wonder is a joke. I was so disappointed and surprised how bad it was."
Good quick food near GWB bus terminal?,Looking for a place to have a quick dinner before my bus out of the GWB bus terminal this evening. Budget is $20 or so (can stretch a little bit if necessary) - would love any recommendations!,"Terravita is a nice little fusion place with great ambiance but it would be stretching your budget a little. Empanadas Monumental has great empanadas, not a place you can sit down but if you'd be plenty under your budget. I've never dined in there but takeout from Malecon (Dominican) has been pretty good. | Fort Washington bakery and deli and Tampopo Ramen are both good options nearby | Seconding Malecon, just get 2-3 empanadas if you're pressed for time. Burger Heights is great too though if you want something fast and easy to eat | Tu cachapa | Burger Heights! | Do you know if the GWB bus terminal has benches I can sit/eat on? | Also recommend Terravita! | Forgot about this place, this is also a good one! | I also like Malecon | I'm 85% sure it does, up at the top where the buses depart from | I’ll go for that one then!

Thanksgiving meal ,"So here’s the thing.   My husband and I are visiting his sister and her family for Thanksgiving in NY.  They happen to be vegans.  No hate at all, I totally respect their lifestyle.  However I am feeling bummed that I will be missing out on what I consider to be a “proper” turkey dinner. 

We have a few days in the city after the holiday. I was wondering if anyone knew of a place I could grab some kind of turkey and stuffing meal.  Even just a Thanksgiving style sandwich or something? 

I realize this might be silly to some, but this is serious for me. I need gravy - the real kind. ","Are you looking for eat in or take out? Some recent ideas:

Best dishes with goat cheese in the city?,"Random request, but I really love goat cheese, and am always excited when I find it in a good dish (pasta, salad, appetizer, etc.). Does anyone have any restaurant recs with a good goat cheese item on the menu?

-Peace, love, & goat cheese","Koliba, a Czech restaurant in Astoria, has a Goat Cheese Spätzle I dream about | maison harlem- in harlem right off the a/b/c/d train 125th street stop the BEST croustillant de chevre, to die for - always perfectly crispy on the outside, yummy soft goat cheese on inside and served on a lightly dressed bed of spinach. delicious 

  
Croustillant de chevre- crispy phyllo pastry filled with goat cheese & spinach, on a cherry tomato & spinach | Ammazzacafe makes a very nice goat cheese pasta. I think it has mushrooms and pesto in it too.

Also, not a restaurant, but Jeni’s makes an incredible goat cheese & red cherry ice cream. Some NYC grocery stores sell pints, though there aren’t any scoop shops around here. | As an Astoria resident, thank you! Will have to check that out, sounds amazing  | Adding to my list!

French Toast NYC Recs,Where would you take someone for their birthday brunch in NYC for unforgettable French toast please and thank you?,"-	Thai Diner’s Thai Tea Babka French Toast
-	Kong Sihk Tong’s Golden Lava French Toast | La Bonbonniere! | Sailor  

Figure Eight  

Thai Diner | What do you want out of your unforgettable french toast?  Just like a basic custard + bread done well? Spectacular toppings? Specific toppings (ie: are they a chocolate fiend? Love berries?)? Deep fried or not?  Some giant towering monstrosity (yes pls)?

I'm a huge fan of the 'french toast' from Kong Shik Tong, but it's probably not what you're looking for ;P

There are more lux versions in various Asian dessert shops, but I don't have a great rec.

One of the various French bistro/cafe types would be good for classic versions.  Buvette is the one that jumps to mind. | Oouuuu thank you for such an in depth response. Well, I did a lil tik tok research and the options I came up with are: Sadelle’s (which doesn’t look great but ppl rave about), Marks off Madison, Madre and Sailor which honestly looks the best but is hard to get a reservation. Recently had really good challah French toast with berries and just tastes great so I guess not so much about the toppings just something you’d wanna go back for immediately after eating. | Do take a look at Buvette, it's one of those places that's dressed like a local eatery, but is well setup to be celebratory.  I haven't had the French toast, but it does look excellent (brioche for bread, and drowned in creme anglaise w/ fresh berries).

That said, they're well known and popular, and don't take reservations that I know of. | Will definitely consider, thanks again for your in depth and prompt responses, much appreciated!"
Ivan Ramen - hadn’t been for almost a decade. Ramen shop still hits. ,"Get the Crispy Pork Buns and Spicy Miso Ramen (if you like spicy). This spot is still one of my favorite ramen shops in the city. 

What are your favorites?

Btw - impeccable service and great staff here too. Needed some comfort food the other day and this place didn’t disappoint. Will be back soon, especially if this weather ever gets colder. 

Ivan Ramen - https://www.ivanramen.com","One of the few ramen places in NYC that you know makes their broth from scratch.  So many new ramen places are buying concentrates and just adding water.   | Tabetomo is my favorite bowl in the city. They do a 60 hour broth and it’s incredible. 

Totto is second when you’re feeling that paitan specific craving 

Ivan is really good too | Love this place and haven't been in forever. There's just one problem. The fact that their appetizers are so good ALMOST steals some shine from the ramen. They had a yuzu chicken ramen the last time I went and I think it was one of my favorite meals ever, not just ramen. | Surprised by the comments here. Loved the Netflix episode and finally got to visit earlier this year. I was pretty underwhelmed - maybe I ordered wrong but it was just average. Maybe my hopes were too high from the show….

I guess to me it’s good but not worth traveling out of my neighborhood for. | Chad the bartender/co-owner is the man. As great as the ramen is, I think the small plates are the highlight of the restaurant. The pickled daikon with XO is an all time dish, the seasonal squash with black sesame and mustard is one of my bites of the year, and the kare-age is always on point. One of the few places I feel didn't lose a step POST Covid. | The eggplant app and the chicken paitan ramen are both absolute knockouts. | chicken paitan is my fave there | I hated the ramen I had there years ago. My top is toribro in HK | It was… fine. | Really? It’s my least favorite of the popular ramen bars here.

Radio Bakery - No Lines in the AM,No lines in the morning. However no lunch focaccias or the 10am pastries either (corn cake) ,"Aren’t lines usually minimal on weekdays?

This place looks delicious.  
On the long list it goes! | When is the Prospect Heights location opening? | This isn't that unusual for Thursday, I don't think.

I know because I waited in it, and it was only growing. This was at 10:15am. I've been about 10 times and previously only waited up to 15 minutes, or just walked right in even, so this also surprised me! | i love the spot but the line is def not 20 mins. one time i tried to wait in ""the line"" and 15-20 mins passed im not even half way there | Their cornbread. So good | This is the first good news I have heard all week. | still bad on Fridays. source: me, there at 8:45am today | Cause their food is just hype.

I think lots of tourists were out and about exploring. | I walked by a little before 11am yesterday (Wednesday) and there was a decent line as well. I usually go around 10am on a weekday, so I’m guessing weekdays aren’t too bad until the lunchtime focaccia sandwiches become available | 9:30am on weekends are when regular groups show up.

"""Detroit-style"" Sichuan in Chinatown?","Maybe a dumb question.  We are traveling from Motown to Midtown this week and are going to be looking for some tasty Sichuan in Chinatown.

Polo Bar,"Do you have to sell your soul for a reservation?

Should I stop wasting my time? ","I’m beginning to resent the place. I’ve tried two years in a row to get a table in December. Even tried Amex platinum this year- called them before the dates opened- got a speech how they had a rep who worked directly w Polo Bar and they really wanted card holders to get the reservation- got a call they couldn’t secure the reservation. I’ve called and talked to reservationists and he said that morning there was over 600 calls and it’s luck of the draw- but that’s just nonsense bc you see influencers there all month and you know they didn’t get “lucky” I think it’s all connections now and if you’re a regular very high spender. I went a few years ago when it was easier to get a reservation and in 2023 I went and took a 5:15 Resy. I think you’re best bet is to just try and call and ask if they have anything available for literally any day 🙃 | Bot and liars and people with connections!

One of the various articles about reservations specifically used Polo Bar and the people there talked about the fact that it's pretty normal for them to get a sob story, bend over backwards to accommodate, and then there clearly was no mom who just beat cancer in the party that shows up (and the writer got a reservation at Polo Bar b/c of contacts iirc).

So, if you have a legit thing to celebrate, talk to them about it.  Let them know if it's your anniversary, or you're coming in from out of town for your once in a lifetime trip to NYC, or whatever.  I obviously don't condone lying, but I do encourage you to play up the human element, it is the Hospitality industry, they want to give people a good time (in exchange for gobs of cash). | I understand your frustration.  I used to have no problem getting a rez if I sat on hold for an hour and was willing to eat at 5:00 or 10:00….my how times have changed.  I have sat on hold 3 times over the past month after dialing in right at 10:00 only to be told they are completely booked on the day that just opened.  So frustrating! I have also tried to go through Amex Concierge and they had no luck either.  I always knew the “important people” got the prime dining hours but don’t know who’s getting the early and late ones now.  Any intel would be appreciated. | No I called and got it | Just call at 10am sharp a month out and wait for 45-50 mins you will get it | I agree.

Restaurant recommendations for American food in Manhattan,"Hey guys! Visiting NYC soon w family and we want somewhere delicious and lively (not fine dining but also still sit down and classy), and good drinks. Doesn't have to be purely American food but want somewhere that doesn't have the purpose of taking you to a different country. Was thinking of doing ""Cozy Royale"" but we're staying in Harlem so might be far? Any help appreciated, thanks!","[deleted] | Sylvia's in Harlem is an institution for Soul Food. Worth the experience if you're from abroad. Dinosaur BBQ is another Harlem spot that's quite popular | Minetta Tavern, Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, PJ Clarke’s (og location), any of the big steakhouses, Balthazar (more French, but still feels very New York), Monkey Bar, Maison Pickle. | The Manhattan equivalents of Cozy Royale would be something like Au Cheval or The Lions. Or if you want something closer to Harlem, Jacob's Pickles.

Or if you want to spend a bit more money, there are a bunch of midtown steakhouses that are about as ""American"" as it gets. | Jacob’s Pickles in UWS | Cookshop is reliable but not challenging, lively but not too loud, and you can walk the High Line before or after. | Definitely PJ Clarke’s | Minetta tavern

For the more known places, Red Rooster, Sylvia’s or Corner Social, Harlem Shake, Sottocasa Pizzeria. | The Smith is a pretty safe menu | Melba’s or Amy Ruth’s in Harlem. As American as it gets | Union Square Cafe | Minetta Tavern | Red Rooster- great chicken! | Depends on what you’re looking for from a “lively” perspective but American Bar might be a solid option. Solid drinks, diverse menu with a country club theme. It’s a bit of a young WV crowd but I have brought family a couple of times and they’ve enjoyed the people watching. | Otis | File Gumbo bar for proper cajun | Harding's is great and has a historic NY/americana vibe.

Seconding Sylvia's and Dinosaur BBQ as spots in Harlem to check out! | Jacobs pickle | Lillies Victorian Establishment | Red Rooster seems to be the place to go. | The Smith.

My family is from Cajun country and I haven't had good Cajun or Creole in the city (outside of my own kitchen) since...maybe since Jacques-Imo's closed a long-ass time ago. | The Smith is where locals take their visiting parents with the knowledge that it easy, decent, but also totally boring.

I absolutely recommend it. 

The other place that is also authentic is Lowerline in Brooklyn. I mention Lowerline only because I've gotten many stamps of approval by folks from Cajun country that I know. | OP is clearly not set on an interesting dining experience.

Keen’s is a great resto that others are suggesting but it’s like a pub in there. Not what travelers envision when asking for American. Jacob’s pickles in uws was a good suggestion and I will 2nd the smith. | How do you know their parents are American?

What to do when one of your favs has a C?,"A neighborhood spot I would go to all the time got a C — i looked up on that nyc website and says latest inspection was 2023 which can’t be right. How often id that updated?

The food has never been weird suspect and tastes good. Not dead. They are very disorganized though, Would you go? ","You can look up inspection results online. There are some penalties that are pretty asinine, but usually, a C means there were quite a few infractions.

They also usually give a place two attempts before giving the letter, if it's not an A on the first go.

https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/restaurant-grades.page | Nah bro. C is bad. | My friend's husband owns a coffee company,  so he's in restaurants installing and servicing machines all the time. She keeps trying to tell me about dirty kitchens, and I'm always like NO, don't ruin everywhere for me! Remember when Phoebe dated the health inspector? | Dude stop going there. This is as someone who's worked in restaurants for the past 14 years, if it doesn't have an A it means there's lots of issues. An A is basically saying it's minor infractions but nothing major. A B is when there's either lots of infractions (think like 20) or you have signs of roaches or rats. You only get a C when you have both rats and roaches or just failed every other infractions and I mean literally all of them. 

If you think of it as a point system to better put it in perspective an A is anything above like a 65-70. Like you have to actually mess up to get lower. A B is like 50-65 and a C is anything below that

They do inspections once a year and they were a little late on them this year so having it from 2023 isn't uncommon, place i work just got inspected like a month ago.

Also when you get anything below an A they give you a few weeks to fix the problems and come back to reinspect it. The fact they've had a C this entire time means that they got reinspected and still didn't solve the problems. | They’re tightening up more and handing out less A’s each infraction is also a dollar fine DOH is looking to make money of course. Also every Restraunt in NYC has fruit flies for the past 4 years. Each one spotted is a point. Even if they don’t notice it’s the same fly.  We’ve spent a lot of money to try to find a fix. I’m a chef. I honestly do things the right way and put in the extra effort to clean because I care for our guests and have integrity. They’ll still find something to hit the quota. | Nope, I’ve stopped going to places I loved, because of their Cs. 🤮😭 | My husband works in the industry. Do you know how bad a restaurant has to be to get a C? VERY bad. It also means they didn’t/couldn’t/wouldn’t improve their conditions when given the opportunity. | I don't ever look at the ratings, and I definitely don't look up the specific violations. 

Ignorance is bliss. | YES I WOULD lol. I say that bc a lot of great spots in Chinatown have a C yet I go anyway and have never gotten sick. It’s NYC eats 🤷🏻‍♀️ | GET IN MY BELLY | Ignore it you’ll be fine | I am now super curious about which spot this is | This happened recently with a spot I liked. But I won't eat anywhere with a C, especially rats/roaches. I'd consider a B restaurant but I wouldn't be thrilled. | C also means they couldn't get a B when they were reinspected, or didn't bother getting reinspected while they went with Grade Pending so they could improve to get a better grade. | A C is concerning, like super dirty/unsanitary. 

I probably wouldn’t go. Like, I have pretty high standards of food safety for my amateur home cooking, I’m not gonna go to a restaurant where professionals aren't capable of doing that. 

I can understand if people are more lax at home that they may not care. | Kitchens in our homes probably would get a C! | It means run away. | Just go. | fuck it we ball | I am okay with C’s. Usually they are Chinese restaurants. They’ve been cooking that way for 5000 years and it seems to be working out for them. There are 1.4 billion Chinese in the world. | Ppl that cares about grading system never traveled outside of their city block. | If it looks and taste fine and violations aren't outrageous, I would probably still eat there.

People have different opinions and takes on the meaningfulness of the grades though like from this related recent post: [Do you eat at “Grade Pending” places?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1ficnpj/do_you_eat_at_grade_pending_places/) | I went in person to one of my Doordash faves and they had a ""Grade pending"". Both restaurants on either side have As. I'm not going back. | That’s up to the store.  They can take the lower letter grade and be done with it, or take the Grade Pending card and expect a reinspection within a certain amount of time.  That also entails paying fines so that may be a reason why small independent businesses choose the B or C. | So i did look up, and latest inspection was 2023. But still pulling a C. What does that mean? | Sushi joints often get dinged for serving raw food so..... | Ugh i know | See you ladle! | I mean, could be a Ratatouille situation?

/s | Your point system analogy is off because it's a lot closer than you think it is. Certain infractions are worth 1 point, others are worth more. An A is 0-10 points, a B is 11-20, and a C is 21-30. There was an article in the Times about it a few years ago that the vast majority of restaurants, fall between and 9 and 12 points. It further stated that the difference between an A and a B usually comes down to how the inspector was feeling that day.

Still, not saying you should be eating anywhere that has a C, though. | It's happened to me. Don't eat there. Be strong. C is bad. | This is a cop type answer, and just completely off base. It’s really easy to get points, every restaurant in the city has a health inspector fire drill, getting a B could be as easy as one person dropping the ball on moving around their sani buckets or whatever. The rules are often pretty arbitrary, as another poster said, they literally count flies and add a point for each, and every restaurant in New York has flies right now. | A neighborhood friend burst my bubble | haha yeah... neither do i. if I get sick afterward, a or not... i'm never going again. that's my rating. a or f. | THIS. if you live in NYC, theres roaches at home. So its whatever … I found a roach in my noodles before, let them know and they “changed it.” Did they really? Who knows but I didnt get sick and ignorance is bliss. I will continue going there because I will never be able to replicate the dishes myself.

To each their own. | And then it will get out of your belly very quickly! | Ill never tell sadly, i am rooting for them! | Rodents and roaches. But thats jan 2023 according to the web. No way its the same now right? | I was not aware of that. I knew that challenging their infractions can lead to more fines, but not this part of it. It's really the part that makes it seem like so much more of a racket. | They still have to pay fines for the infractions even if they don’t do the reinspection, and I believe that with a certain number of critical violations they are required to be reinspected regardless. | It just means the health department hasn't gotten around to reinspecting since that C. They've been very backed up since COVID (and honestly beforehand). You are supposed to receive an inspection once to twice a year, depending on how well/poorly you did before. | Thanks for clarifying it was sarcasm, I really thought you were asking if a sentient rat could be controlling the chef in a kitchen from inside his hat. | Obviously. Too progressive right now, DOH doesn’t get it. | That's actually the wrong way to look at things.


A is when you have 0-13 points, or up to 13 sanitary violations. B is 14-27 sanitary violations. 

Anything more than 28 is a C. C can be very bad to horrific, but not bad enough to be forced to close.

And people should avoid C. It means either they couldn't get a A or B; or didn't bother to go with a Grade Pending to improve. | Speak for yourself I grew up in this city and so did my parents and we do not/have not ever had roaches in our home | naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah a roach in my food?! i'm not only getting up and never going to the restaurant but i'm never eating in that general vicinity again. | Oh it’s such a racket.  I would put my support behind any politician who would streamline the DOH inspection scam. | I knew I had the scale slightly off. Thank you for the correction. | Then you’ve never had to live in a tenement walk up or public housing. Thank you for showing your privilege ✌️ | These inspections are stupid easy to pass, though. | [removed] | No hate, flamewars, rude comments, etc"

Otherwise 3-egg omelets at any bodega/deli is probably your answer. | Was binge was IASIP and feel like this would be the basis of an episode, haha | Just make yourself egg salad my guy | That’s a bit eggxtreme | Buy big jugs of egg salad, it’s basically eggs and mayo, and you can buy it in huge tubs. You can make your own sandwiches with basically any bread, and maybe lettuce and tomato | You should learn how to make Chinese steamed eggs in the microwave at work | Cant help as far as grabbing them, but hard boiled options dont require reheating. Devilled eggs, curried egg salad, tuna and egg salad, red beet pickled eggs, buffalo pickled eggs, and dill pickled eggs are a few good options. | Do you live on the streets? Boil some eggs at home | Microeggonomic | That just cracked me up, friend. Keep being awesome. | Lol. | Mini quiches are similar.  You can make a dozen and freeze.  You don't have to cook them a 2nd time... just let them get to room temp. | Yes. It was common all the way into the 80’s. | I was about to recommend this. I love the Trader Joe’s premade hardboiled eggs. And I have a bag of whole  Foods 365 in my fridge now. Also quite good. 🥚 | Aka ""leggo my eggo"""

All tacos come with guac included. | Update: I ended up trying a cart on 34th near 10th Av (Eric's? I think). Tacos were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for taste, but did a respectable job at 3 for $12.

Caravan of Dreams,"I wanted to put a plug in for Caravan of Dreams which I used to enjoy regularly from 2014-2017 when I lived in the East Village. I live in Queens now but was strolling by today and popped in for a dessert with my girlfriend. The food was great as I remembered.

They're vegan but above all are delicious and use organic ingredients. The place has an intimate European cafe vibe with live music and friendly service. The desserts are delicious but not too sweet. It's been around since the 90's but I'm afraid they'll be the next victim of the post-pandemic dining scene without some support!",

You’re welcome! | Happy boards! | Bedford Avenue cheese shop | Grand central market has a big selection of luxury cured meats, cheeses, fancy crackers, caviar, pickles items etc. I agree Eataly is GREAT! (I have mostly been to the union square one and love it) but it’s huge and can get veryyy crowded especially with Xmas around the corner. If you are looking to get something quick and still have luxury foods to choose from, I would go here. I love the truffle foie gras, at a reasonable price point too.

Artisanal... | couldn't have said it better myself | For anyone saying Eataly, it’s DiPalo’s. Buy local and support family owned businesses. Plus their mozzarella is the best in the city. | And as a PSA - they sometimes actually have sales on their cheeses (like 50%). I’ve gotten burrata half off a few times | Eataly's produce is very fairly priced. It used to be actually **cheap** but now it's an average price for very above-average goods. | Yes, I just get as much hand sliced Pata Negra bellota ham as I can afford, and I'm done. Pointless to bother with the other stuff if that's available. | Seconding Spitfire! They have a great variety of cheeses.

Prepared Thanksgiving Meals for 1?,What are the best places in NYC this year to pick up a prepared Thanksgiving meal for one?,"Whole Foods! 

They have a variety of options and you could probably even order a meal for one. And they have a really wide window of pick up times. I have gotten Thanksgiving dinner for 4 from the Union Square location and it was so easy to pick up and tasted really good! | During COVID I picked up from the Friedman's on West End.  It was great, a ton of food, fresh, delicious.  If not for family obligation, I would do it again! | Does it have to be a pickup?

The Lil' Frankies restaurant group (Supper, etc) famously invites solo diners for Thanksgiving.

Old Taipan Bakery Food Item,"Hi, recently I've started craving something I used to eat when I was a little kid like 20-25 years ago from Taipan Bakery in Flushing. They used to serve hot food items back then and this was a grilled boneless chicken thigh with this thick spicy black pepper sauce over ham fried rice that they used to sell for like $5-$6. The last time I had it was probably in highschool around 16 years ago since I remember taking my best friend from back then to get it.

"Three Nights in NYC for GF’s Birthday – Looking for Dining Recs!

","Greetings from Toronto. I’m heading to NYC for three nights in early December to celebrate my girlfriend’s birthday. We’re staying in NoMad but are willing to explore all over Manhattan for some great dining experiences.

**Birthday Dinner**: Looking for an intimate spot with that NYC vibe– somewhere romantic with great service. Open to any cuisine (except Korean, though Jua has caught my eye). Right now, I’m considering **Clinton 63**, **Estela**, or **Minetta Tavern**. Any thoughts on these? Or any other suggestions for a special night?

**Italian Night**: Hoping to book at **Torrisi**, **Via Carota**, **L’Artusi**, or **San Sabino** for one night, though I know reservations can be tough. Would love any other recs if those don’t work out!

","One thing I can pick out is Senza. I thought their pasta was TERRIBLE. I was surprised. I would rather buy Barilla's GF pasta and cook it at home. | I'd recommend Loring Place on W. 8th St. for cocktails near Comedy Cellar.  Bar Pisellino is great too; it's on Grove and 7th Ave. | I thought the fruit sando at Postcard was extremely mid at best. Maybe its not a fair comparison because this is the only fruit sando that I've ever had but I got the strawberry one and it basically tasted like a shitty strawberry shortcake lol. The bread is more dry compared to a cake and I thought there wasn't enough cream, which also contributed to the dryness. Maybe their other stuff is better but I felt like Postcard are known for their fruit sandos.

It's not a dessert but I would highly recommend [Pomme Frites](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k7PurfHKeHgD8EMp8) across the street from the Comedy Cellar. It's a Belgium Fries shop, they make the fries fresh and have over 30 sauces you can pick from. You can ask for samples and they'll squirt a bit of sauce on a napkin and give you a few fries to try the sauce before you make a whole order of it. It's one of my favorite shops in the city, personally I like the Dill Lemon (it grew on me the more I had it lol) and the Sweet Mango Chutney. | Are you really really into pricey gimmicky cocktail bars? You have a lot of them listed. If that’s your thing then yeah. I do wanna give a heads up I mean this are just the big name ones.  Maybe this are just the only bars you know in the city. And they’re all basically the same. $20 drinks in a spot for tourists that are sorta a one time gimmick. 

We have tons of great bars. Like you can do one of these and see how you feel. You go in, it’s a gimmick it’s just like every other fancy cocktail bar. You spend $40+ for two drinks and then decide if you wanna walk back up to the bar and drop another $40 15-20 min later. There’s only so long your pocket book can take that action | Oh no! Thanks for the feedback. Any GF restaurants with pasta you’d recommend? | Thanks for the recommendation! I’m looking them up | OMG thank for that recommendation. 100% added to the list of musts | I’m into really good cocktails and these bars have consistently come up as good places to go to in my searches. Looking at the menus I do see quite a bit of variation tho 🤷🏼‍♂️. I’m happy to hear of any alternatives you have. | Unfortunately I don't know of any. I was scarred by Senza and never tried again! | NP! I would strongly recommend just getting their regular fries + sauce. The poutine sounds delicious but it's meh and kind of a trap. | These bars come up because they are written about online, not necessarily because they are the 'best'. But they are fine. I'm more saying, that why don't you check out 1 and if you like it, OK do a second. But they get VERY pricey and its frankly a bit of a tourist gimmick after one drink at these high end, publicized places.

NYC has amazing bars, great dive bars, whatever you like. Especially if you're going out to the East Village/Lower East side or West Village where most of these are. I'd say cocktail bars, sure hit one or so, maybe two if you totally love it, but don't go wild that you have to hit 3 instagram cocktail bars or your trip is ruined and blow all your money and effort."

Blue Smoke will be closing it's doors in December after about 20 years. But not before they do a few collab dinner nights.,,"A bit more detail:These begin at 5pm on their respective nights. 

Some of you may be familiar with Blue Smoke in serving BBQ in Flatiron originally, then moving to Battery Park. The founder, Danny Meyer is finally closing the doors to this iconic BBQ restaurant. But before they do, Blue Smoke has been doing a few collabs over the years and they're going out with a bang with these highlights. 

The special collab menus are posted on social media a few days beforehand. 

Currently, Bret Lunsford, former executive chef of Blue Smoke, now the Culinary Director of Sally's Apizza will be bringing 

1. Calabrian Arancini - Mozzerella and pulled pork stuffed risotto balls, served with pesto-whipped ricotta (similar to what he served in Pig Island 2023 for those who attended)

2. Italian Glazed Kansis City Spare Ribs - Glazed ribs w. garlic bread and rosemary parm mashed potatoes.

Smoke Sweats BBQ is a popup BBQ spot that won 2nd place at Rib King 2023 and 2024, and 2nd place at Brisket King 2024. He leans in on his Maltese heritage on his seasonings but still makes sure to properly smoke his meats low and slow and truly aims for balanced but lasting flavors that make you want more.

Kimchi Smoke started off as a popup in NYC breweries (especially Rockaway Brewing in LIC) but has become an established Texas style BBQ joint in NJ but with a Korean flair to his dishes (namely kimchi as is his namesake). He won Pig Island 2022, best Pastrami at Brisket King in 2023, and so on as he's competed in several competitions over the years including against Bobby Flay. 

Menu TBD - But Smoke Sweats is doing Picanha.

Chris Lilly probably needs the least amount of introduction for anyone in BBQ considering he's been inducted into the BBQ Hall of Fame, winning 5 Memphis in May championships with Big Bob Gibson, and so many more. The team is based out of Alabama so this is the perfect chance to try their BBQ if you haven't been to the yearly Jeff Michner BBQ charity!

Menu - Also TBD | great memories eating their ribs at citi field as a kid | I ate at Big Bob Gibson in Decatur, AL, a few years ago and it was by far the best barbecue chicken I’ve ever had. Everything else was fairly pedestrian but the chicken was incredible. | Blue Smoke was trash eight years ago | Sort of a bummer because frankly before Blue Smoke, BBQ and BBQ culture was nowhere in NYC. The festival alone that they sponsored was huge to introducing NYers to great bbq. That said, there’s a lot more traction now so they’re probably unnecessary. | blue shmoke blue shmoke ayy | USHG auditions | Never got to try them unforutnately | Awesome info. Thanks for sharing! | Why would they close it? | thanks for this! already made my reservation! | When you say ""start at 5pm"" do you know if that means we can make a reservation those nights at any time after 5pm and get the collab menu? | Fascinating! I've only had their stuff at the Jeff Michner foundation event but I'd love to visit if only for BBQ. 

This year they did a solid lamb rack (i don't even like lamb and the sauce made it amazing for me). | It served a purpose when the only BBQ that most of the city new about was Dallas. But the city's moved past whatever they are now.  | It's definitely improved once they had Bret Lunsford as the executive chef since he's born and raised in Georgia with roots in BBQ. He's also been acclaimed enough to compete in Chopped at the very least! | Bc it's just another one of Danny's phoned in restaurants on life support at this point. He's lost in the Shack Sauce. | based on their insta comments, they said ""dinner only, 5PM and on omwards."" im assuming dinner service is 5PM and onward. 

im also going to assume ""while it lasts"" so if you go later in the night, they might be out of the specials. | [deleted] | I love Blue smoke though. so idk whatever he is doing seems fine. | Brick and mortar - 

* Pig Beach (Astoria) - Solid ribs, brisket, etc. Nothing mind blowing but they have happy hour wings and $5 draft beers.

* Hometown BBQ (Red Hook, Industry city)- Probably the most famous, along with Durney's other spot Red Hook Tavern if you're hankering for a burger

* Virgil's - EMergency BBQ craving satisfaction since they're a time square spot and are about par for the course (not great but good enough)

* Mighty Quinns - don't go here

* Mabel's smokehouse (Williamsburg) - Weds ayce ribs, Thurs wings. Solid, nothing mind blowing but you come here for the AYCE deal really 

* Dinosaur bbq - This seems ot be hit or miss for most people. I personally like them and their ribs. They're also always doing fun stuff with sauces

* Hill country - Very standard, but solid bbq

* Bark bbq (Dumbo) - Texas styled BBQ with a dominican flair (like instead of pig belly it's chicharon). Listed in Texas Monthly top 50 outside Texas

* Morgan's (near Bayclays) - I haven't had them at their restaurants but I've had them at competitions and they have solid brisket and ribs

* John Brown bbq (LIC) -Literal only Kansas City style BBQ in NY

* Fette Sau (Williamsburg) - Haven't had them since they supposedly got better again. But I heard some people say good things about it as of 2 years ago. 

* Empire BBQ* (Bushwick) - Special mention on this because they were running a food truck first. ANd now they're working the kitchen side of Hank's (bar). They won Brisket King 2023 (i think) and Rib King 2024 so they know what they're doing. 

Those are the ones off the top of my head that are brick and mortar NYC. But there are also popups if you're interested in those:

- Jase BBQ - Was at smorgasburg but now is only doing takeaway in Rockaway at Postcard Brewing. Tobago flairs on traditional BBQ so jerk brisket, ribs, pig tails (won people's choice Pig Island 2024), etc.

- Spiced Smoke BBQ - Mostly servicing LI and Queens for their popups but their smoked oxtail is one of a kind and so good. But of course they got the wings, the ribs, the brisket, the jerk chicken fried rice

- Smoke Sweats BBQ - Mentioned in my other post here

- Smoak City - I've heard a lot of good things about this BBQ food truck but i haven't had the chance to stop by their random popup spots yet

- Tikkun BBQ - He's slowed down on the brisket and ribs and has been focusing mainly on burgers and hotdogs. Still a decent dude with pretty good food 

- The Dancing Pig - Solid ribs and brisket. He won a special mention award at Rib King 2024 for his riblettes. 

There are probably other popups and maybe other spots, but there has been definitely a downturn in BBQ over the years.

If you want some of the best BBQ that can be offered in NYC for a night, there are about 5 major BBQ events in NYC every year - 

1. Brisket King - April at Pig Beach. $60 ticket for AYCE and Drink while supplies last 

2. Jeff Michner BBQ Foundation - $200 at Pig Beach - BUT literally pitmasters all over the country show up to do BBQ for charity here. All the proceeds go to kids who are aspiring chefs to honor the late Jeff Michner (pitmaster of PB)

3. Rib King - May at Industry City. Same deal as Brisket King

4. Blues BBQ Fest - Pier 76? I wanna say? Free blues music all day but come early or you'lll wait on line forever. They invite about 6-8 BBQ spots that you just buy whatever you want. 2 from NJ who always show up - Kimchi Smoke and Big Papa Smoke Em

5. Pig Island - Same deal as Brisket and Rib King. But at Snug Harbor in Staten Island (I know but you literally get whole hog bbq and a celebration of alll things pork) | I don't know, we lost a lot of the good ones. 


Maybe Bark or Hometown


Hill country if you're on Manhattan.  | I'm still mad at the kid who destroyed RUB by stealing a hummer and also injuring 8 people | [deleted] | Fette Sau | Dinosaur BBQ wants a word…brisket is still top notch | I mean if you can make that drive out then 1000% go to them and Hindsight BBQ. They're both mentioned in Texas Monthly's top 50 outside Texas and have some great people and food. 

Hoodoo id say follow Tyler Hodge on Instagram (tylerhodge66) to see what weekly sausage special he cooked up that week too! | Worked with a lot of Texans. They all swear it’s the best BBQ in the city. Really makes me wonder who is going around saying they’re bad. 

Well got their ribs a few nights ago, still fall off the bones. | I had Dinosaur like 3 years ago and their stuff was dry as heck. | While I love Dino, “fall-off-the-bone” is not a qualifier for good BBQ ribs, the best smoked ribs have some pull, but are not tough. Fall-off-the-bone is a characteristic of braised ribs, which are delicious, but a totally different category from BBQ."

"What cuisine, if you had to narrow it down to one, is each borough best in?",,"Bronx/Upper Manhattan: Latino food
Queens: Asian food
Staten Island: Italian food
Manhattan: Fancy food
Brooklyn: Sort of fancy food |  This is way too broad to narrow it down and also “best in” could mean what restaurants are the highest quality or relative to other boroughs what’s it best in.

Staten Island has pretty relatively high quality Italian, sushi, and Vietnamese and imo the median places are better than the median in the rest of the city (manhattan at least) but that’s not exactly unique

Staten Island has quite a few good Sri Lankan restaurants which are gonna be hard to come by elsewhere but imo they’re nothing special | Impossible to do due to the various communities within each borough. The question is reductive, but I could list the most prevalent cusines . . .

Manhattan: True melting pot

Brooklyn: Chinese, Mexican, Middle Eastern, Italian

Queens: Chinese, Filipino, Korean 

Staten Island: Italian, Cajun/Creole | Brooklyn: pizza. Im saying jt | didn't realize fancy food was a cusine | queens better | As much as Manhattan is a neighborhood lol | tru"
Korean restaurant recommendations please (lunch or dinner).,The subject line says it all. Thanks a bunch.,"hint: give us an area of the city, budget, what kind of Korean food | Her Name is Han | Nubiani is kbbq with upscale vibes, they have a location on 32nd and one on I think E54th, their banchan (side dish) game is the strongest I’ve found in Manhattan in the last few years. They are a little more expensive than Jongro or similar, but they also won’t rush you through your meal or fail to offer basics like ssam, which has been an issue with a few of the 32nd St spots post pandemic. | What kind of Korean food are you looking for? Preferred neighborhood, vibe, and price range?

Some general recs:

- Cho Dang Gol
- Turntable Chicken Jazz
- Jongro
- Mapo
- Parksanbal
- Daesung Korean Chicken
- Hahm Ji Bach
- Hainan
- Tofu Tofu
- Kuun
- Rokstar Chicken
- Mad for Chicken
- Kimganae | I really like Chingoo and Dokebi in Williamsburg if you're willing to venture out there. | Specifically the weekday lunch sets | this list right here. only thing I can think to add is Hojokban

also shout out to Hahm Ji Bach. Wish I found myself around Murray Hill (queens not manhattan) more because that place is so legit | Hojokban is a good add. 

And yesss Hahm Ji Bach is legit. Easy ride on the LIRR to get there and lots of other good Korean food in that area."
Why the hell are there always 50 people in front of every Crumbl cookies?,"I have walked by several different Crumbls recently just minding my own business and there has consistently been a ridiculous line down the street. Why? They are just oversize, oversugared cookies. I kinda get waiting in line for a uniquely NY place/place with some historic or cultural value, but Crumbl is just a random cookie chain. Don't people have better things to do with their time?","Free cookie if you have t mobile and today is the last day | I agree that they suck. But don’t forget that NYC is a world class city with people visiting America for the very first time. Obviously that isn’t always the case but it’s a consideration that explains why they would be in demand with tourists.I can only imagine all the sucky chain restaurants that New Yorkers eat when they visit other countries for the first time. I remember my first time eating at a Hema in Utrect NL and being excited about curry chicken and chips. | They are the worst cookies 🍪 yuck | Ooooohhh pink box pretty!

But seriously, they're uninteresting mall cookies. | Someone at my office was raving about these stupid cookies so we ordered them for an event.  My God they are so fucking ugly, on top of being ridiculously sweet.  Those people are delusional. | Insomnia cookies are way better tbh. | Hate these cookies… they are soooo sweet. I feel like they all taste the same. Like a mouth full of sugar | Those cookies are trash | Because people are fat sheep. Literally a million better cookies in the city | i always see this, it's insane to me! the cookies suckkk. and there's a bunch of them, why wait on line you could probably find another with no line. | Truly a terrible cookie | They want to instagram how much of a foodie they are! /s | They're a Utah-based chain. The LDS missionaries that are assigned here want a piece of home | sheeple lmao. | Some recent discussion on the popularity of Crumbl: [Why has Crumbl in the West Village had huge ass lines lately?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1g6pq1f/why_has_crumbl_in_the_west_village_had_huge_ass/) | Not enough supply to meet demand | Those are the transplants and tourists | they pay people to stand in line. | Because this city is full of suburbanite transplants looking to recreate their strip mall experiences. | Because douchenozzle transplants from the flyover states think they’re missing out on something special. Newsflash: they’re not. | I wouldn’t really say that Crumbl is a ‘random’ cookie chain. Not only have they gone viral on social media in the last few months, but given that they change their flavors weekly, they recently introduced new desserts (cakes, cheesecakes, banana pudding, etc.), and that they offer unique cookie flavors that other cookie chains don’t typically offer, I’d say that the Crumbl experience is unique enough to warrant waiting in line for it. 

And the lines move quickly anyhow, so it’s not like people are there for hours. | It’s mostly kids. And unless they’re in an after school club, kids typically don’t have better things to do with their time, to be fair. Waiting in line for cookies with friends isn’t much different from killing time at the mall. 

In terms of Crumbl in particular, they have a pretty good marketing thing going. Their flavors rotate every week and they have a rating system in the app for you to track your favorites. Trying and ranking them with friends and online (TikTok in particular) becomes an activity, and since they change weekly, people come back for new flavors or favorite old flavors. The pink boxes are great advertising both because people take pictures of them and because they’re noticeable when carried around on the street or brought into an event. 

Agree their cookies aren’t great, but prior to living in NYC, I thought $5 was a pretty good deal for a cookie that ended up being 4 servings for how sweet it was. At least compared to a cupcake bakery like Sprinkles or something of that nature. It’s an alright treat if you’re not in NYC.  | Nastiest cookies ever. How do you make sugar and butter taste bad? | I am also so curious! Every single day it has a huge line. Can’t you just order on Uber eats? Like what’s driving these long huge lines? | I took advantage of the T-Mobile offer the other day and I was seriously annoyed by the wait. A lot of it seemed to be tourists and teenagers (maybe because of TikTok?) ordering multiple boxes of the stuff, so they weren't just the T-Mobile freeloaders like me. One of them was a father and his son with the father taking pics of him standing in front of the store, posing while ordering at the POS Terminal, etc.

I got a lot of reading done while on the line, which is the only reason it wasn't a complete waste of time for me. The cookie itself was OK. Thought I'd become pre-diabetic when I was halfway through. | The munchies | Social media hype and look at me behavior | Their Head of Marketing must be amazing. They turned a dry, overly sweet cookie into a viral TikTok sensation. It’s bananas. The inside is also so white and the lights are blinding. Not sure how people can handle standing in that place. | it's a cult.  they're not that good.  insomnia cookie is so much better. | Honestly, I understand in places where it's hard to find any decent desserts, not in places with ample phenomenal bakeries and dessert shops like the city. | They also usually park in the turn lane/bike lane/crosswalk at Columbus Ave and W74th, while in line for their cookies. | If you live in nyc you have far better options. I get why people in other areas like them though. They are overpriced but they change weekly. | Oh, that explains it. I walked to the UES location several days ago hoping to get a pumpkin cake and the line was at least 40 annoying school girls long. I ended up leaving after 5 minutes and bought cubed watermelon and a container of apple cider from the new Whole Paycheck Daily a couple blocks away. | Social media. 

The cause for so much of society's brain rot. | I’m convinced they figured out some sort of TikTok hack that makes people think it’s amazing… I have been completely baffled by this exact same phenomenon Of lines at crumbl. | i get unreasonably angry when i see these Crumbl lines | Probably obesity. | Those cookies are teeth-cracking diabetes bombs. Ugh 🤮 | I just walked by twice tonight. 6 and 8 pm. 45 people in line. I said out loud it’s just a cookie as I do at other Instagram famous places. I just don’t get it. | because its trash and mfs love trash | The cookies are so bad. I don’t get it. | my girlfriend is addicted to them. | It’s a crazy demand. If they don’t stay above 50 people on line, their kiosk explodes! | I completely forgot about T-Mobile Tuesday | Ahhhhh, that's why it's been wild recently. That actually makes it make sense | Damn. Welp. | Taste and feels like baked play dough | This is the perfect description | I swear I thought I was the only one who doesn’t like Crumbl because they all just taste like straight up sugar regardless of flavor… Obviously people have different preferences but people genuinely go crazy over them and buy like a dozen at a time | Some of them are 700 calories a cookie. It makes me sick that people consume them willingly and then complain about their wellness/body composition. | When they first opened, I used to love them bc they were not sweet! and the unique flavors actually shined thru. But I had a chance to have them twice more recently, and I don’t know what happened but they were different cookies! Way too sweet!!! And the flavors were all so similar sugary buttery with only a hint of the flavor it was named after maybe added to a very similar base?? I was so disappointed bc i still remember the taste of when they first opened way back ago… Not planning to go back anymore & currently searching for a new cookie place. | I couldn't believe how bad it was when I tried it. None of the flavors came through for me because the sugar overpowered everything. | Yea too sweet but the staffs are friendly though | I used to be an Insomnia hater but my work got them catered once and the snickerdoodle and oatmeal raisin were fireeee. Still do not like the chocolate chip or double chocolate though. | The red velvet cookies are divine. | It appears to be mostly tourists visiting the one near me. I see them online with suitcases and bags straight from JFK in the morning waiting on the store to open. It seems to have only started this summer from my observation.

I just don’t understand the hype for such a terrible product. | T Mobile was giving out free one’s too | Seriously-- feels like several subs periodically have a ""Why do people like Crumbl???"" post and the comments are all just people complaining about how sweet the cookies are and how there are better alternatives. | Today is Monday? | Wouldn’t eat those cookies for free. Calories are too precious to waste on shitty cookies. | I feel like it’s a status thing? Like Stanley cups when that was at the height. Social media and social standards | That much?  There should be an Ozempic syringe in each box. | Each Tuesday there’s a new deal and that lasts for a week until the following Tuesday | 😂😂😂😂 | Oh. I’m so out of the loop. Lol"

Birthday Dinner Options,"Hi, I am looking to celebrate my birthday in NYC and planning to host around 10 people. Preferably I would want a place that can be open till late so that when clocks hit 12 we can do a cheers. Dining preferance would probably be italian or mediterranean. Or if you can help me, let me know where can i take a big group after dinner if the place closes early.  I am hopping a place that is nice, vibey, dark (not too bright), good seating and good alcohol. About $100-$200 per person is the budget. ","sushi blossoms please go your life will be changed… had it once when my sister visited town and her boss took us + her whole team there, I’ve gone back for my birthday with friends and everyone was obsessed. Now it’s a luxury date night for me & mine. 

Best meal I’ve EVER had.

I cannot cannot cannot recommend it enough and I consider myself a foodie privy to a handful of other spots.

I’ll let others recommend different locations but for your budget per person you can all enjoy their Omakase menu.

It. Is. The. BEST."
Lunch in TriBeCa,"Hi! A VP from my company would like me to find a restaurant where we can have an extended lunch (2-3 hours).

She wants it to be near her hotel in TriBeCa (she is staying at the Mariott)

Do y'all have any suggestions?","There doesn't seem to be a Marriott in Tribeca. There's a Marriott at the World Trade Center. Or there's a Sheraton right on Canal Street (which is owned by Marriott, so maybe that's where the confusion is coming in).

Anyway, if it's the Sheraton, you should look at Locanda Verde or Wolfgang's. Those were basically created for corporate lunches.

If it's the Marriott, look at Nobu or Sant Ambroeus. | Locanda Verde | Scalini fedelli | Paros or Frenchette | The Odeon is where what I would choose! | Manhatta ;) but if you’re looking for a lower price point tons of choices at Brookfield Place and Eataly | Can you clarify which Marriott? The Courtyard?

Here’s some options in the meantime:
- The Greek
- Estancia 460
- Wolfgang’s 
- Locanda Verde
- Paros Tribeca | Pretty much anything on Greenwich street is good (Citi HQ is on Greenwich, so lots of suits walking around). Locanda Verde, wolfgang steakhouse, gigino trattoria, frenchette, tamarind tribeca, paros, | Temple court would impress. The atrium in the bar room is beautiful. | The Odeon | Laconda Verde at Greenwich hotel | The  Odeon on 145 West Broadway. A  NY institution. Just call prior and explain your request they will be happy to help you. 212-233-0607 | Barolo | Beef bar! | Wolfgangs is perfect for a business lunch | Give Benares TriBeCa a shot! Fine dining Indian restaurant. We go there for work meeting all the time for 2/3 hours. They are nice. | And if it is the Sheraton, tell her she's a 5 minute walk to the Ghostbusters Fire House. | Seconding - great for a work lunch | I love this place so much. One of the first nicer restaurants I went to in New York 15 years ago and it is still a great spot to go to for a quiet meal. | Second Frenchette | Frenchette was great for lunch! Sit in the front because lighting in the back is ‘yellow’ | [deleted] | Definitely the Odeon. Such a quintessential spot in the area. They might start giving OP the signal to leave near the 3 hour mark though. | They really don’t mind lingerers and it’s a great place to have a conversation for a few hours | It feels like such a hidden gem! | What did you get at Paros? | I’ve only been there a few times and maybe I just never really stay in a restaurant for more than 3 hours anyways but I’ve never noticed this lol"
Pan suisse,"Does anyone know where I can get a real pan suisse (preferably downtown Manhattan)

Thank you ","I know you asked for downtown Manhattan but the best pain suisse I’ve had in nyc is at Laurel bakery in Brooklyn | Cafe D’Avignon in essex market! | Levain bakery - they go by a different name but essentially is a pain suisse - and they’re great! | So the best I've had in New York so far is at Somedays in Astoria. Everything else was mid, but the pain suisse was top tier.




Nick and Sons in Greenpoint has a ""razorclam"", which is a pain suisse by another name and it's pretty decent. 





La Cabra's was awful imo, but excited for some other places to hopefully pop up in this thread! | What’s it called?"
Best Manhattan Steakhouse for a group of guys? I know best steakhouse has been asked many times - I’m trying to find the best for like 10 middle aged guys for our annual holiday dinner. ,,"Sloppy steaks at Truffoni’s | Strip House speakeasy | Can never go wrong at Wolfgang’s. | Most steakhouses are great for large, celebratory gatherings. | Keens! So good and underrated | Bowery Meat Company is a good setup. | Maybe do like Fogo de Chao instead? That’s always fun with a group | Keens will always be my go to. Had a steak night with a group from work. Group of 25. It was a great night. The restaurant was very accommodating to all of our needs. | Hawksmoore is pretty great. | porter house bar and grill | Vinyl Steakhouse..great music as well | Del Friscos | Hawksmoor has a lot of options for a big group. | Sapphire New York on 60th | Do any of these places allow the steaks to be sloppy? | I liked Strip House when it was independent | I second Keens. | Keens | Keens. Or Wolfgang’s. | I'll always suggest Keens. The ambiance is great, old NY, but not stuff or pretentious. The steak is great. Nothing says middle aged guy more than Keen's mutton chop! | Buenos Aries | Like Harry’s for BNO | Weekend wine at smith & wollensky pretty solid for a group | Keen’s, Quality Meats, Bower Meat Company, Striphouse are among my favorites. Wolfgang’s and Gallagher’s seem to be very well received too from others | If you want to feel like Kings, Wolfgangs. Been there 2 times, always great | Truffoni’s | Highly suggest &sons they have a private room in the back just for steak and it feels super super intimate. Last time I went there was a group of 7-8 guys that looked like they had a blast and it’s all reasonably priced so you can splurge on drinks + sides + whatever else you want | Wolfgang's | Shouldn't you be looking for a sausage place? | Keens | I’m a big fan of Harry’s in FiDi (Hanover) .. big round table would probably suit 10.. | No sloppy steaks guys, please | They say "" You can't do sloppy steaks"" but they can't stop you from ordering a steak and a glass of water! | This is the answer  | Just hosted 15 people here. Everyone was happy and if you signup for Landry’s loyalty thing, you can get ~10% back in gift cards on the pre-tax/tip check. 

Will definitely be bringing big groups back. | Hot take but Wolfgang’s is the only steakhouse I’ve been to in the city that’s left me very disappointed. Ordered my steak medium rare and it came out blue, sent it back and it came out well done. IMO you’re much better off at a place like Keens or Delmonicos. | And you can choose whichever location and get the same great meal which is convenient if you have plans after. | … underrated? | Keen’s is a classic white tablecloth joint. Love it. | Was going to say this. They have interesting larger format dishes that are hard to tackle as small parties (duck lasagne, etc) | I will never go back to Bowery Meat Company after they tried to present a 2nd growth as a Chateau Margaux Grand Cru first growth, such a dick move and a joke of a restaurant. Also, the 100-day dry aged steak was flavorless, if it was even 28 days I’d be shocked. The entire restaurant is a bait and switch. | Wouldn’t be any fun if they did. The whole point of sloppy steaks is breaking the rules | They can’t stop you from ordering a steak and a glass of water! | Ha! I see what you did there - 😂. Don’t feel bad that you don’t have any buddies that want to hang with you. | SLOP ‘EM UP!!! | Ive also been very disappointed by wolfgangs plus service was terrible. Definitely +1 for keens or Delmonicos over Wolfgang | Not sure if it’s a hot take. But it happens. Pick any restaurant and it happens. It’s never been my experience and I’ve been to multiple locations and many times. | Things u/shervinsworlddotcom also finds underrated:
-coffee
-Apple iPhones
-sex
-bags to carry things in | It's crazy that it is underrated. | Tough experience. Hopefully just a one off. 

They haven't had a 100 day dry in about a year, and don't dry age in-house, so maybe it was a purveyor issue.

I'd never order that regardless. It would taste like a mouthful of dirt. 100 days is way too long. | I know how you kids like em extra sloppy!"
Thanksgiving goose nyc,Trying to find locations that serve goose in NYC thanksgiving day,"Hard to find goose in the city, and if you do it'll probably be pricey.Its sometimes available frozen would be near the duck and capon. | I just saw that Citarella has it on their Thanksgiving menu (take out/order ahead)!

Best Asian/Italian easy-to-get-reservations Michelin Restaurants?,"Hi, I’m looking to take someone out on a nice Michelin dinner during the month of November preferably on the weekends.

Was thinking that it'd be cool to find a sampler/platter situation to try a variety of salsas, but as long as it's great salsa, it would work. Some places I've considered:

Ensenada-Williamsburg: seems they have a good variety of salsas, but maybe a bit on the fancy/not authentic side.

Mezcali & Los Tacos: Sounds okay, but maybe a little generic/chain-y. Seems there are a lot of casual tex-mex spots throughout the city that have decent food, but not sure about the salsa specifically.

Chinantla - heard the salsa was amazing, but only have red and green, and the dining experience looks very hole-in-the-wall (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a factor)

Any recommendations are appreciated! Help me nail the second date! 🙏","Oxomoco in greenpoint has a salsa sampler of 6 or 8 of their salsas and it’s good. Not the typical salsa though and much more exploratory/unique just fyi but I enjoyed it. Good luck! | I thought Cruz del Sur had some pretty impressive salsas (albeit, not a huge range) when I went. Seems like they've closed their original location in Prospect Heights indefinitely, though? Not sure what's up with that. | Good luck and have fun! | Empellon taqueria has a salsa tasting that is very good. Siete salsas. | Ensenada would be my pick. Also get their pineapple butter for whatever you order. | They have a diff/newer spot that’s more easily accessible near Barclays"
Open Restaurants in NYC on Christmas? ,"I am taking my family to New York for Christmas this year. We are staying in Downtown Brooklyn and I am looking for food recommendations either in Brooklyn, Manhattan, or just about anywhere in the city!

I am looking for any (not super expensive) places to eat on Christmas Eve + Christmas Day. Is there any breakfast/brunch options open as well as lunch/dinner options?  I heard that Chinatown should stay open on Christmas day, but I wanted to get some more recommendations so that I can make reservations early before it's all booked up.

I appreciate any recommendations, thanks!","Yes, most Chinese restaurants will be opened. It is the busiest day of the year for them. | Go on open table, there are hundreds of restaurants open. Most diners will be open for breakfast. | Chinese restaurants, particularly in Chinatown. Back in the day, (not particularly strict kosher-observant!) Jewish families would go to Chinese restaurants on Christmas.  It was a shared ""outsider immigrant"" tradition. | More places will post menus and open up reservations right after Thanksgiving. | Minetta tavern. Actually a great Christmas atmosphere | Leave Chinatown to the Jews please. Y’all have 364 other days of the year to eat lo mein | Same with thanksgiving?? | No, I think many of them are closed. For some, I think that is the only holiday that they are closed."
Sushi Happy Hour?,Anyone have any sushi happy hours they love in Manhattan? Love sushi but also love a good deal when I can find one! ,"I think your better bet is lunch specials. Sushi 35 West has great / affordable lunch specials. | New Mikado on 14th. 
Just heard about it via insta lol | Sushi Goda on 3rd ave UES! | Noz Market handroll happy hour | Hama on 51st btw 5th and 6th lower level if you’re in Midtown. Nice selection of rolls. | Asuka Sushi on 23rd has good lunch deals and I’m pretty sure they have happy hour or at least used to lol | Zest sushi in Les | Second this"
Momo sauce,This might be a long shot but does anyone know the recipe for the  momo hot sauce that you find in Jackson Heights? I love it so much.,"Try starting with sambal oelek (hoy fong makes a good one), I think it's reasonably close (but iirc the Tibetan style is a bit dryer).

Or you can try making a Tibetan style hot sauce.  Here's one from [The NYTimes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12315-tibetan-hot-sauce?unlocked_article_code=1.XU4.N_38.KRT_PDCP9A-a&smid=share-url). | The orange ones are usually a combo of roasted tomato and sesame, with garlic, ginger, chilies, cumin, cilantro, maybe some more spices based on the store.

The deep red one is a chili sauce, mostly blended chilies - I think probably dry red chilies that are soaked in water.  Maybe salt, garlic, or vinegar."
Anniversary dinner recommendations,Staying in Chelsea for a few days and looking for a restaurant to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary!,"Ci Siamo, Jack & Charles No. 18, Gramercy Tavern, Rezdorra (then midnight blue for cocktails & jazz) | River Cafe"

[https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-and-l-hawaiian-barbecue-new-york-3](https://www.yelp.com/biz/l-and-l-hawaiian-barbecue-new-york-3)","i was just talking to my friend the other day about how much we miss hawaiian bbq 🥹 looks tasty, i’m hype for the one opening in harlem. what were prices like? | Tried it today! Great service. Had it with one of my Hawaiian friends, they concurred that it was better than most L&L's. | let's fucking goooooo i've been waiting for this | Looks great! I would love to see the menu. | Yeah and how are prices? | They sell malasadas which is enough to get homesick to trek from any borough. 

The prices are all like .50 high, which really is fine except for musubi. They need a number starting with a 3, even 3.99. 

The kalua pork looks ok in the pic. 

I'm just glad they'll have loco moco and regular plate lunch, Shanghainese lumpia and malasadas, everything else is gravy. I think I went to L & L in like 2005-08 in Manhattan, but I also recall a spot in Forest Hills and some Filipino/Hawaiian menu items in Woodside area. I think everything closed I mentioned. | Nice!  I miss the one that was on Fulton Street.  | FUCKKKKK YES I have been missing Hawaiian mac salad so bad I can’t wait to try it | The food looks good, but what about the prices? | Fucking love this place | A lowres image of the menu can be found on Yelp [here](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-and-l-hawaiian-barbecue-new-york-3?select=H3-TEgXIUf3SP2qDEzDxVA)

I hope it's more consistent than their old location in FiDi. It was dirty and they somehow gave me raw pork katsu. | Everyone asking about menu and prices - it is all on their insta story/highlights @[llhawaiianbbqnyc](https://www.instagram.com/llhawaiianbbqnyc?igsh=MXM5YmdmZGN2MGZsYQ==) | Bro, can you upload your photos to imgur, yelp is making me create an account, and I can't stand them.  | Looks amazing I’m there this week . Hopefully for a celebratory reason | I’m a big guy with an appetite i can definitely handle a plate however i have my wife and toddler . Can they handle one order and me one order ?

Hype-y / Showy places to take guests,"Hello! My in laws are visiting again from Europe (Central/Eastern) and I’m looking for suggestions for  “hypey / showy / cool” restaurants to take them to. They’re neither the most picky / adventurous about food nor have the most refined palate so it doesn’t need to be the best meal of your life, but I’m looking for crowd pleasers restaurants with visually “wow”effect dishes that they can’t get back home. 

For example, they loved the butter service at Quality Bistro, turkey legs at Jacob’s Pickles, etc. 

I’m thinking of Manhatta (mainly for views), Au Cheval (burger w bacon & egg), Peking duck (prob Uluh), Francie (duck), Don Angie (the rolled lasagna, if I can manage a res), Coqodaq (obvious reasons, if I can manage a res). Any other recs? ","Not wow food, but best view in the city potentially. Manhatta. Get cocktails at least. Heard the burger is good but haven’t had it. | I always mention afternoon tea at Bergdorf - amazing views of Central Park. | When are they coming?  If Nov 19th or later, try the Dead Rabbit when they've got their 'jingle jangle' decorations. Also great holiday cocktails | They get a lot of hate on here, but Bad Roman would 100% wow my out of town relatives

Also Aquavit with that birds nest dessert. | Westlight at the top of the William Vale hotel. | This is a list that has been used on my picky 40 y/o creative director sister and my partners ‘foodie’ parents (who once flew to Oslo from Melbourne Aus just for a dinner reservation).

Outertowners love a red sauce Italian joint and want to try a good New York slice, they also want a rooftop cocktail and a good bagel. They like the East Coast Lobster pound vibe. They love the view in Dumbo (and taking the ferry there if possible). They also like the idea of sitting at an old school New York diner and the classic Parisian inspired Low-lit New York bistro.

So here’s my hit list (with options where available)

Red Sauce Italian:

- Bamonte’s (food is ok, Sopranos vibe, bookable).

- Emilio Bellato (you’ll get in if you line up).

- Carbone (if you can get a res).


Pizza (slice):

- Joes (Bleeker street location)
- industry 
- scars 
- upside 

(There’s so many more but this is a good cross section and they’re close enough to each other in Manhattan to make a pizza eating day out of it).

Bagels/ New York Jewish:

- Russ and Daughters (the restaurant, every guest I’ve taken there has loved it).

- Appolo is fun at the moment (you line up but it’s not too crazy).
- any local store you like
- Barney Green Grass
- (obligatory but they love it) Katz Pastrami sandwich 

Lobster:

- Sit on the roof at Brooklyn Crab in Red Hook where you can see lady liberty in the distance (and take the ferry there if you can). 

Oysters:

- Grand Central Oyster bar

Drinks with a view:
- Overstory (the view is better than Manhatta, you can walk around outside and you only have to pay for cocktails rather than an entire meal, you can book it it is incredible)
- The view from the roof of the 1 hotel in Dumbo.
- The Crown (The view from this Chinatown hotel gives you all three bridges at once)

New York classics:
- Waverley Inn
- Balthasar 
- Minetta Tavern (waaay better burger and vibe than Au Chuval).
- Keens 

Wine bar restaurants:
- Ruffian
- Penny
- four horsemen (if you can get a reso)
- Sailor
- Jem Wine

Diners:

- Joe Jrs
- Diner
- Empire Diner 

- Lexington  Candy Shop 

Other (hyper/cool)
- Thai Diner
- Friedmans 
- Dimes Square is fun (Kiki’s or Cervo for food).
- Rintintin
- Chinese Tuxedo | Try Hojokban. It’s Korean food that’s v pic-worthy for insta and p decent imo | What about a dim sum hall or a classic NYC steakhouse? | Oscar Wilde for over the top decor | Paradise lost is always a good time and great drinks. | Tao / buddakan, only bc it’s huge and scene-y. It’s what I thought NYC was like growing up in the Midwest lololol. Can get Peking duck at either. 

Not like scene-y or trendy at all, but golden wuish has a Peking duck that they set up fire in front of you and carve in front of you. 

Mission ceviche presentation is nice, if you like Peruvian food. 

Cote is better than cocodaq (so incredibly overhyped) | If they’re up for a trip out to Flushing, Juqi makes a very good Peking Duck and has a number of showy dishes, like the flaming fried rice, Mister Rabbit mashed potatoes, mah jongg pudding, etc etc. | Hutong, Per Se, Coté, Blue Ribbon Sushi & Steak, Keen’s, Quality Meats, Il Mulino, Ippudo | The Grill | I haven’t been since it was Sea Grill but the restaurant facing the ice at Rockefeller center would probably be pretty exciting. It’s an Italian restaurant called Jupiter now. Another place I’ve never been but probably a cool experience would be Peak at the top of Hudson Yards. Clearly I have limited info but hopefully this is helpful lol | Yakitori Totto | Especially for the Eastern Europeans, go to Sveta. Amazing food and fun decor. | Carbone (WOW factor old Italian vibes), Bangkok Supper Club (so delicious/hard to get a res), Fish Cheeks (the steamed fish), Nami Nori (handroll bar - interesting for out of towners), Konban (so delicious modern asian), Ichiran (best ramen and unique solo seating and can sit side by side anyway), Tempura Matsui (love me a tempura omakase), Rezdora (interesting and intriguing pastas), Afternoon tea at the Baccarat Hotel (just wow!!), Peter Luger (the cheeseburger, the bacon, the steak), Keens (i mean the pipes on the ceiling!), Nubiani (better than Cote or Coqadaq) | Carbone 
Friedmans
Sarabeths at Central Park 
The Dead Rabbit or Lillie’s Victorian Establishment | Torissi | Hutong Peking duck can be set on fire lol (golden wuish was mentioned too and that was also very good but the overall vibe of hutong is nicer because it’s nicer / bigger and has a lovely bar area, whereas golden wuish inside is nice but it is in a Sheraton and like the bathroom is in the Sheraton lobby) - and the hutong dessert tower (I think it is called the treasure bowl) is a showstopper — it comes with dry ice oozing “smoke” out of it and the plating of each dessert is stunning plus when you put them together. (We did our wedding at hutong and when the dessert towers came out that was a highlight for our guests) | Olive garden times square | Balthazar, Bad Roman, fosrsynthia, sailor | Especially for the Eastern Europeans, go to Sveta. Amazing food and fun decor. | Mr Chow on 57th. The noodle show is always fun. Love it on a Sunday. | Literally was updating post to include manhatta - already on list!! | Although I disagree on the food - it’s excellent, and a sweet menu, too. Extra plus: Excellent service. A very special place. | went last friday for lunch and was blown away. | Great rec! They’re coming 12/26 so this sounds perfect tbh | Yes Bad Roman | Lowkey also do want to try it for myself to see what the hype is about | Ahhh yess!!! The short rib - agree agree | hojokban is ridiculously good but I wouldn’t consider it a “show-y” place | I wish you could go there without actually, you know, ordering anything. The drinks and food are the most overpriced, mediocre crap I've ever had in the city. Not awful, just not even remotely worth the insane prices they charge. Service sucks too. We had the douchiest bartender I've ever had in NYC and that's really saying something. | How are the vibes of Oscar Wilde vs Rolf’s? | Second this! My Czech friends had never heard of a tiki bar until I explained to them. We got to go to one in Paris and the friend I went with loved it! | Took them to cote last visit! Good rec about golden wuish, will look into | Buddhakan actually has a great Peking Duck and most of their food is honestly great. Loud though, so tough at times to have conversations. | Yes, especially the duck press pasta | And the prime rib from the cart | I’m not a local but am there about once a quarter to meet with clients. Took a couple there last summer and they were like “how have we never been here?” and started taking pictures like they were tourists. I knew I found a special place after that lol | I love Bad Roman! Is it the best ever? No! But is it yummy enough with a cool atmosphere? 100%! And now reservations are quite easy to get | It’s in the lobby of a Sheraton so ambiance is a bit suspect lol but the flaming duck was good! | lol this was exactly what I did when I walked in too 😂😂😂"
Dinner near the beacon theater?,"longtime NYC resident but just never on the UWS. I’m seeing a show on Friday night at the beacon theatre and figure it’s a good opp to try a new restaurant in the area! any great recs within walking distance (~<20 mins)? TIA!

","Cafe Luxembourg | Sala Thai is right by the theatre and pretty good! | If you like Turkish/ Middle eastern food, Leyla is one of my favorite sports in the city. Everything is absolutely delicious | Any more parameters? It’s not new, but I just had a great meal at Tessa last week.  New-ish but not as close is El Fish Marisqueria. | Jacob’s pickles is a few blocks north, always reliable | avoid shun lee, was once a diamond in the hood, now is just an overpriced tourist trap getting by on its previous fame | Red Farm is a block away and always stellar. | Do you want fancy? Get a seat at the bar at essential by Christopher. If Jose is bartending, you’ll be in great hands for a cocktail. | I went to la dinastia, an old-school chino-latino restaurant, when i went to a show at the beacon. i personally wasn't blown away, but it's an NYC institution for sure | Salumeria Rosi | Wau is a really good Malaysian place and song e napule is great for neopolitan pizza. Celeste is also a great neighborhood option (that always has delicious and unique daily specials) but make sure you bring cash - it's cash only. | You might want to check out the other threads on here specific to the UWS. | Tenzen | How about Papaya King on 72nd? | Chama Mama | Tessa | Jeff Arcuri show?

ETA: If you want good, classic Chinese there is New Cottage @ 78th & Broadway. | Miriam for great Mediterranean right around the corner or Crave Fish Bar a few blocks up. | Salumeria Rosi or Arte Cafe for Italian

ZiZi Wine bar. Middle Eastern. Very good chicken kebabs. Really good Humus and hot pitas.

American.  The Ribbon. | Tacombi, Sala Thai | Nice Matin. Shun lee | Seconding this! We were there last month for a show and stopped in beforehand. Sat at the bar and had a great meal. Overall was 10/10 quintessential buzzy UWS vibes and the bartender was fantastic. | Love Sala Thai and the martinis are great | [deleted] | no parameters, open to anything! thanks for the recs :) | 100% correct | I was about to post this. Never had a bad meal at Red Farm. | In the meantime:

Raku, Polpette, El Gallo, The Wolf, St. James’ Gate, La Dinastia, Chick Chick, Bodega 88, Salumeria Rosi, Miriam, Osteria Cotta, Dagon, Bustan, George Keely, Amelie, Osteria Accademia, and others. You have your pick if you walk up or down Columbus, Amsterdam, and Broadway | Do you mean Gray's Papaya? | Also going to Jeff Arcuri on Friday. Landed here looking for dinner beforehand as well lol | thank you! and I’ll def check out the other threads | I betray my age… yes, that’s it. | I love Gray's Papaya.  But while we're on the subject, how does Papaya King hold up?  Are they just as good? | I’ve enjoyed NY’s version of filet mignon for over 50 years and indiscriminately, drawing no distinctions between papaya & dog purveyors… I can only remember being disappointed one time, this comes from my frankfurterest personal era, and that was when I heard the price for two dogs and choice of drinks had been raised from $1.90. | Papaya King on East 86th Street was the original, and Gray's was founded when a manager from Papaya King started his own. 

They're functionally identical, but there's a UWS vs UES tribalism fight over which is preferred."
"My visit to the L&L Hawaiian Barbeque at the 201 Allen St, LES location","So I heard a few weeks ago that L&L Hawaiian was opening up 3 new franchise locations in NYC. Two in Manhattan (LES, East Harlem) and 1 in Brooklyn (Bushwick),  

The LES one at 201 Allen St has an official Grand Opening set for Saturday, November 9th, but they actually opened up yesterday Nov 2nd. I wasn't able to go since the notification came too late in the afternoon and I had already ordered in. So today I went at around 11:30 AM.

It reminded me of the one that L&L use to have on Fulton street many moons ago, except that this one looks nicer with the iconic surfboard and numerous tables, I met one of the owners Henry and we chatted while waiting for our order to arrive to the table. We talked about possible future location in Queens.

Ordering was easy, took about 6 minutes waiting in line, mostly local folks. I can imagine this being much longer once after the grand opening and word gets out.

We ordered the Kalua Pork, Macaroni salad, rice combo, the Garlic Shrimp combo, a spam musubi, Lumpia and a few Hawaiian Sun drinks. Food tasted great, awesome or as fellow Hawaiians would say ONO.

I wasn't able to met the other owner, Henrys' sister, since she was helping out in the kitchen. The only thing on the menu missing today was the Malasadas. Which is fine, since it gives me another reason to come back. lol

BTW, I passed by the Brooklyn Bushwick location over at 902 Broadway and Myrtle and it's still being worked on. They say a November opening, but I feel it may be a bit into Dec by the looks of things. ","Thanks for the run down! Did you end up taking any pics? | Any chance they had meat jun on the menu? I dream of having a place to get that here!!! I’m so excited about malasadas, thanks for your report!! | How much for your combo plate? | I went there saturday night and ordered the kalua pork combo, they were out of malasadas then too. I thought the pork was tasty enough, but they were soooooo cheap with it. They give a ton of cabbage, but barely any pork. That guy henry was nice enough though. | I uploaded 6 pics both here and in my post in Facebook. Don't know why its not showing. 2 of the are of the menu. Strange. The post on facebook is pending review, so I wonder if thats what's happening here due to the images. | I just looked at the menu, no, its not listed. | I created another post with the images.

What to try at Katagiri store? ,I am not Japanese and not too familiar with Japanese home cooking. I am fascinated with the Katagiri store and the wide variety of grocery items there.

What is the texture/flavor, not clear from the photo. | Last time I was there, I was seated at the counter and fascinated to see that they have it cook in the pan before flipping (it holds the shape). | I'm pretty sure they use a ratio of rice or tapioca flour within their mixture, but that's all I can add. More likely the latter due to how fluffy and chewy it is. Rice flour is less fluffy. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. | Very fluffy almost soufflé like. They’re tremendous. | It's very fluffy and somewhat chewy. Takes in syrup and holds its shape very well without dissolving, which leads me to believe its a ratio of tapioca or rice flour."

Bar recommendations for appetizers,"Staying in Manhattan for 4 nights and have three dinner reservations. For Thursday night, we are thinking about bar hopping to 3-4 places and grabbing an appetizer at a few.

Resys ,"
Been trying to get the top 20 spot that is famous for being good but tough to get a reservation. I’m not asking how to get one of those places, I quit. 

I’m looking for the next list of places that are really popular but that if I go when the new resys come open, I can most likely snag one. The places that might be just off the main list of impossible ones but are still very popular. 

I’m coming from out of town and would like something pretty well known. I understand locals know the better smaller spots but that’s not what I’m looking for. Only interested in Manhattan since I won’t be there to long. Thanks for any help if in fact these places exist. 

","Most of the 3 Micheline star places aren't all that hard to book, so you could just go to Per Se or Le Bernardin.

If you'd like real suggestions you'll have to let us know how much you want to spend, what sort of food you do/don't like/eat, and what sort of vibe do you want. | I had my boyfriends dad go through his amex centurion concierge and it was no issue for these situations.

Weekday lunch around Columbus Circle,"Does anyone have recs for a weekday lunch on the UWS/specifically within 10 blocks or so of columbus circle? Going with a friend who can't eat most asian food due to dietary restrictions which knocks out most of my usuals in the area. Flexible with price, not looking for 100/per person but anything under is fine","Karshaval Garden | Souvlaki GR, All & Sundry, Angelo’s | Not sure if the dietary restrictions knock out din tai fung dim sum since it’s Asian? but it’s great for vegans and non-vegans alike there.

La Bonne Soupe is a great French place in that area as well, as is Quality Bistro.

Loi Estiatorio is a nice Greek place as well that is right there.

Edited for spelling. | All & Sundry | Masseria dei Vini | The Independent Cafè is an underrated gem with plenty of seating.

Good $7 Halal Carts?,"Obviously this has been talked about a lot but where are the cheap (and good) halal carts? I’ve seen some $7 ones around 14th and I know LIC has $6 Mando. I know it can be worth paying more $$ for better quality, but I’ve been in a bad streak of bad halal food for the past year regardless of price and my final straw was drunk paying $16 for mid food outside Basement last night (no prices listed) and I feel like I need to make back being scammed that badly lmao. ","Gone are the days of common $7 carts, but some of the best trucks around the city are \~$8-$10. In my experience, the worst of the trucks, mostly around midtown and busy touristic areas (i.e. Central Park) are also the ones that are severely overpriced, making it a double-whammy of regret. Check out the [website](https://www.overrice.nyc/) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thehalalguysguy/) for some of my favorite recs, and let me know what you think! | Like you mentioned, on 14th street, check out Santa and Farook right beside each other in front of the NYU building/TJs between 3rd and 4th ave.

Both are 7$ for lamb or chicken, come with a pita on top, and stack up to most other carts in the city. My favourite is the chicken at Santa’s. | Not all $7, but you can sort by price and rating: https://www.overrice.nyc

It’s made by u/thehalalguysguy who has posted their reviews here before. | There’s a $7 halal cart spot by Hunter College, but I believe it’s only M-F daytimes and evenings. | Mando is exceptionally good and you're going to be hard pressed to find better quality even paying a little more. A lot of the price has to do with location and the time, $6 across the tracks from LIC ensures a large number of customers for lunch, at $10 or that same area late at night it would be crickets. In midtown or club land that's another story. Late night you might not have as many customers, but you can leverage hunger after a late night and bad decisions from alcohol to help make up for the lower sales with higher prices. | Adel’s and Shawarma are open late night, any in the area open during the day? | Halal carts aren’t 7 bucks anymore unfortunately | Halal carts aren’t 7 bucks anymore unfortunately | Nice site!

Thoughts on Zaytinya?,"So I went here a few months ago for a work dinner and I thought it was the biggest ripoff. The menu was full of subpar versions of dishes I’ve had elsewhere. The lamb with hummus was tasteless—like 1/100th as good as Yemen Cafe. The shrimp was a cold sloppy dilly soup. The kebab platter was 75 dollars and on par with any Turkish takeout place. The Brussels tasted like any you would get at a bistro or whatever, imam bayildi was overcooked and came out cold, the mushroom dish was a slimy pile of tasteless whole button mushrooms, etc. the only dish where the price matched the quality was the fries.

Also, the service was bizarre. We came early-ish and it was not crowded. The waiter was attentive; we ordered and got water. Then the shrimp main dish came out immediately, cold. Then the Brussel sprouts came; then two of our drinks came (a soda and a beer); then the grape leaves; then the wine; all of these dishes were delivered by different waiters over the course of 30 minutes as the restaurant got more and more crowded. Then after 20 minutes we got the mushrooms and kebabs. Then 20 minutes after that we got the eggplant appetizer. Then, after 1.5 hours , we got the fries with the check. 

The bathroom situation is weird, too. There is one single person bathroom for a huge restaurant unless you sneak in the ones upstairs in the hotel. 

To conclude: it sucks. As I was waiting I talked to the older woman beside me and she summed it up: “I grew up in Istanbul and this is not got Mediterranean food! But my daughter and her fiancé are visiting and she wants to impress him. I wanted to go to Sarge’s!”","She was good in dune | Yes, it’s bad. The DC location is better but there are certainly much better spots for Mediterranean restaurants in the city, including ilili which is right down the street. | It’s just OK | Even though I've never been I know it's mid. Why? Because when they first opened, they had couple of spelling typos on website menu. I pointed them out privately on their ig account and all they said was ok got it. Yea...the typos weren't edited until few days later. | I enjoy it but the best things on the menu are the dips and the veggie mezze. I fill up on those. Also the zaatar margarita is phenomenal.

The bathroom situation is terrible though! | overpriced hotel food | I loved the DC one when I went like 5 years ago but thought the NY one was another kind of mid midtown factory restaurant | Extremely overrated IMO. I used to live by the one DC and we'd always have company outings there. The food's fine, but it's overpriced for what it is. | One of the worst, overpriced restaurant experiences I've ever had. | It’s good for a hotel restaurant! I like it | This should be higher. | I went to the one in DC and thought it was not good"
"Ramen and tendon bowls from Mitsuwa in Edgewater, NJ",,"Nice, great picks at Mitsuwa.

Miss the shuttle van that went there directly. | Always a treat to make it out here. 

Santouka gets a lot of the attention for their ramen (justifiably), but the tendon place, Kaisen Hannosuke, is one of the underrated gems of Mitsuwa. 

https://mitsuwa.com/nj/ | Love santouka. The special pork bowl with the cheek meat is great.  | Mitsuwa has a special place in my heart. My go to for legit Japanese food and groceries before the recent crop of Japanese restaurants and markets started opening up in the city. | I lived in Edgewater last year and really loved going to that market | i was just thinking about going there. 

that looks delicious! i always get a curry udon. maybe i’ll try that place next time | I like to go at least a couple times a year for the tendon bowls. | The food at Mitsuwa is vastly overrated. Outside of the onigiri at Omusubi Gonbei, the ramen and other foods can be enjoyed at higher quality spots within NYC limits. And OG has a NYC spot near Grand Central. | How does this stack up to top spots in manhattan? Is it worth making the trip from the city to try? | Dont forget Mitsuwa is more expensive than Manhattan\\Queens\\Brooklyn Japanese markets for Japanese groceries and sake\\shochu.  Mitsuwa's sales prices on Sake\\Shochu are higher than Astor Wine's regular prices.  Also cant have a beer in the food court. | I had no idea there was an Omusubi Gonbei location in NYC… thanks for the info!!! | My opinion having gone to Mitsuwa since probably like 2008 is that it’s excellent and easily just as good if not better. I was there a couple weeks ago too. Miss the shuttle that went straight there! | Pour the beer in a container and be subtle. I've never been hassled in well over a decade.

I only head out there for a class trip or to get multiple packages of katsuo tataki | It’s hidden inside Katagiri! Still great though! | You can get Katsuo from sunrise or Yamaseafood. | Ever since MTC Kitcheb stopped their  delivery, I’ve make the trip to Mitsuwa maybe 2-3x a year. I’ve never tried them, but Yamaseafood charges $15 for delivery and their prices seem high to me. 

I don’t mind going to Mitsuwa infrequently, picking up no less than 5 packages of tataki. Maybe if I do a more in depth cost/time analysis, it might make sense. | I only buy when they have a sale or special but I think delivery is free for orders over 150, buy some Uni lol"
Katagiri Store: What to buy ,"I am not Japanese and not too familiar with Japanese home cooking. I am fascinated with Katagiri store and the wide variety of (mostly unfamiliar to me) grocery items. I love their fresh fish and am absolutely obsessed with the yuzu sauce but i could really use some guidance for what else to explore beyond  salmon sashimi. 

What do you usually buy at this store and how do you eat/prepare it at home? Also any recipes using yuzu sauce would be much appreciated!",
Tatiana,,"I thought this was referring to Tatiana at Brighton Beach and was like “damn the menu changed!” | For $86 I'd expect more from a dish. But the hype is so extreme I'm sure it sells out. | 86 dollars for that short rib dish is fucking highway robbery. I don't care how good it is. | I don’t mind dropping $ for fine food but something feels off about their pricing. | I went a few months ago. People mentioned how hard it was to get in or a long wait. I just walked over and [got in line](https://i.ibb.co/dLgZfV8/20241102-105632.jpg) at 5:06 and was [seated](https://i.ibb.co/KVvS6LV/20241102-105748.jpg) by 5:25.

I ordered the Curried Goat Patties and Short Rib Pastrami Suya. The patties came within 4 minutes but the pastrami suya took about 50 minutes. The patties were different than any I've tasted before, but I didn't find them as great as others said they were. The pastrami suya was fantastic, but the price for it alone was more or nearly more than I've paid for entire meals at every other restaurant I've been to.

What did you guys think of Tatiana? | Pricing feels so off. $19 for oxtail crab Rangoon feels ok but then $86 for the large plate feels insane. | I loveddddddd it. So good | I love this place, me and my girl got the Curried king crab and the braised oxtail, the only downside was the wait time which I felt was a bit long. The food was worth it though. | Overhyped. Food is fine but nothing mind blowing. I prefer Katz’s pastrami and I can get three for the price of the one at Tatianna. The drinks weren’t interesting or creative. | Might be harsh but it’s my most disliked dining experience I’ve ever had in NYC. IMO completely overhyped. Went with a few friends and service was below mid. I noticed waiters standing in the corner talking/arguing about something not restaurant related. Drinks took a long time too. We ended up spending $200 a person for a party of 4 and left extremely disappointed. Menu is pretty interesting but the execution was not up to par. The pastrami I got was dry and hard. Might be because it was the end pieces but for $86 that shouldn’t be the case. Not to mention portion sizes compared to price. Oxtail dish only had 4 pieces of oxtail priced at $56. I don’t know what service or food other people were getting because that wasn’t the experience we got. I would say try it once if you’re interested but I personally would never go again. I can fully understand why it didn’t get a star and wouldn’t be surprised if it never does. With a high price tag like that there should be a corresponding level of service or quality of food, which I don’t believe they met. To me it felt like a cash grab combined with an insane amount of social media presence.

Edit: went 12/8/2023 so my thoughts might be a bit dated

Edit 2: saw someone else mention this but the seating and table space was atrocious. They had big ass plates for tiny servings of food that it could barely fit on the table. Does not provide for an enjoyable eating experience when you feel cramped and can barely fit your drink on the table. | Imma ask has anybody tried the curried king crab | $86 for that small portion, I would be livid.  You definitely had to stop at a slice shop on the way home. | Was extremely let down by this place. | Clearly Tatiana is outside of many people’s price point but the food is excellent. The vibe is awesome, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable with regard to the menu and the drinks are good.

Whoever tried to compare their pastrami to Katz’s is a dolt. They aren’t remotely similar in style or preparation.

Restaurant is packed every day. If you’re able to go and able to afford it, the meal is super enjoyable and worth your time. | I will do a walk in because I’m really dying to see the hype. I’ve also certainly been to pricier spots in NYC and wasn’t necessarily satisfied. | When did they get rid of the pastrami being bone in?!?!? | Do they have any vegetarian options? | Went when they first opened so they were definitely working out some kinks. Got the egusi dumplings, goat patties, takeout mushrooms, and the bodega special. Everything was…fine I guess. Mushrooms were definitely the weakest, I see how they could be good but execution just wasn’t there. Would’ve gotten the pastrami but $86 for that portion seems whack, though I’m sure it’s really good. Bodega special was whatever. Service was fine, food was fine, but I’m not sure it deserves all the hype. | No dessert? | I’m very glad to read all these reviews. I work on Lincoln center campus and have been wanting to try Tatiana for a long time so now no I don’t feel like I’m missing out. | I honestly thought the whole experience was garbage. The acoustics in the restaurant are bad and with hard surfaces abound only serving to amplify this.

Seating was uncomfortable and table setups were very close together.

Service was lacklustre to rude at best (though front desk were genuinely engaging).

The food, though I understand it’s an attempt to tell a story just missed. Exorbitantly overpriced and simply middle of the road. The pastrami was simply pastrami dredged in a bizarre red powder of a spice mix.

Want overpriced pastrami in a noisy environment with theme park service? Go to Katz Deli .. | https://youtube.com/@appu2023?si=GIhTsYXC_jSPxojy subscribe and share | How did you get a resy!? | Fire | There’s a reason the chef failed in DC (twice) - his food isn’t that great.

NYC food media is out of control recently; the positive reviews are performative nonsense | I was unimpressed by it. | extremely overrated, would not return | Overrated | Are they still offering that $0.50 Little Debbie Cosmic Brownie (my bad, the bodega special) on the menu for $20?

Also, I don’t know what is more diabolical (or whatever the kids say these days); paying $56 for a small portion of braised oxtail or paying $52 for a standard New Orleans style BBQ shrimp dinner (literally a standard, base level recipe) which is rarely priced more than $25 is even the most revered Creole restaurants… and can be found elsewhere in NYC priced between $20-$25 for double the portion..

But hey. If you all are willing to pay for it. | Braised oxtails were incredible but the cosmic brownie dessert was one of the worst desserts I’ve ever had. It was SO dry and the ice cream was gross. I can’t believe they served it. The prices are also just ridiculous. I don’t understand the hype. | The food is really good to me - I truly do wish the prices would lower just a taaaaaaaaaaaad lol | This is a Ruski p00p place. Not sure if they fixed it, but definitely a loud environment, many Eastern Europeans, your service will absolutely depend on multiple factors that you can’t control. Also, I’m pretty sure this place has been shut down before. 
Unless this is Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, that I have no experience with at all, and it’s a completely different location, restaurant, and business. | OG | They mention the Brighton Beach Tatiana in Anora—was sort of funny seeing it at Alice Tully because I think a portion of the audience thought for a second it was the fancy Tatiana they were referring to, and the restaurant is right next door to the theater. | Supposedly they are closing.  Was there a few weeks ago and it wasn’t like it used to be | lol, yeah was going to be like “why no pictures of the show?” | Three sandwiches at Katz’s! | I don't know how they arrived at that price, I think it should have been $30-35 | It’s literally random dishes that can be found in Black households across the diaspora on any random day made to look “pretty” on a plate and then marked up anywhere from 150% to 3,000% of what it should actually cost. Marked up simply because they can and because they know a certain type of diner in this city will be more than happy to pay for it and then rave about it as if what they ate was some rare treat. | From what I understand they leave a significant portion of their tables open for walk ins (or friends of the staff/restaurant) both due to the Lincoln Center proximity but also to keep up the appearance of every night being sold out. | Waiting 46 minutes between courses for food that expensive would have had me apoplectic lol. | I also went last month and got a resy (shocking I know). It was a bday dinner so I didnt have to pay and im kinda glad, because even though the food was great, the portions just didnt seem worth it for some of them. 



The Cod and Cornbread and the Goat Ribs (dinner special) were the only two things I would say were dishes I would say were 11/10 dishes but everything else was just good! | I got the pastrami, too, when I went last month. I thought that and the bodega dessert were worth the hype. I know people love it hate it but I think it’s really delicious and unique food | was it a weekday? Lucky! | Looks like they’ve changed the menu. It’s a place I would maybe go back but not kill myself over getting a reservation. The oxtails was just okay to me and I forget what else I had. | The prices are higher than some restaurants around Wall St | Yeah, it was nearly 45 minutes between getting my appetizer and main course. | I had the exact opposite experience when I went April of 2023 where everything came out _too_ quick. We were in and out with drinks and a few courses in under an hour. It’s actually one of the reasons I didn’t enjoy it since we felt so rushed. | Kwame is an inexplicable industry darling, and with the amount of hype this place gets, they don't need any regulars to maintain the appearance of success. This place could close down next year and it would still be seen as a massive success off of social media hype alone. | Food was fantastic when I went. Kinda overpriced though I agree, but I immensely enjoyed my meal. | Yep. Tiny crab legs. Like maybe enough meat to form half of a mini crab cake. The sauce was fine but the bread they served it with was horrible. Maybe got four total bites out of the dish, it was rough. | It's either the angle of this picture or the portion has changed since last year. I've been twice and this dish was shared by 3 adults and we were all full after this and 2 appetizers. | Same! It was just OK, and I haven't been inspired to go back. | Care to elaborate more? | Yes the staff was fantastic, they constantly refilled my drink and asked if I needed anything. The atmosphere was great and more laid back than I would have expected. | If you think the food is “fantastic” at Tatiana, you need to dine out more | Interesting, which other places? | The 2 items I got already came up to $150 | Just got in the walk-in line! | These dishes could be around the $25-40 range | My wife and I went there in August because we were moving away from Ditmas Park/Midwood and she had never been to Brighton Beach. But we only got drinks… | Pretty good sammys tho. Can make six if you pay for extra bread🤣 | He did the same thing with his restaurant in dc that closed. Made it super expensive for the sake of being super expensive.  | The patties being $26 felt obscene. The patties at Golden Krust are like $3 | Yeah, it was a Monday | They’ve changed nothing which to me shows they’re not that creative and don’t expect people to come back. | Which items changed? I tried looking at the menu online for months before I went there, many of the pictures of the menus were low res | Wow! It took about an hour alone just to get my main course | That’s fair, I’d never go back. | Like I said, it’s fine. Wildly overhyped and expensive. Would not return. | Service wasn’t great. Was greeted by multiple servers but once our order was in nobody checked in. Food all came out at once, there was barely any room on the small table for the dishes. Bread/Roti that accompanied the dishes were awful. | The playlist they have is 15/10… it’s a totally different vibe from traditional “nice” restaurants.

I’ve been 3x and I think the key to going there is 4+ people and eating family style | Grammercy Tavern, Minetta Tavern (steak was just bad!), Sakagura (All of us hated this.) I have a bunch of others I can’t remember like this horrible Turkish restaurant around Hell’s Kitchen… | Fortune favors the bold…well done | hmmm maybe $50ish range (give or take)- mostly everything is shareable and the quality/quantity is more | Exactly. | GK patties are garbage, sooo… Try Jumieka | I don’t remember egusi or the kitfo being on the menu when I went earlier this year. | That’s a wild conclusion to make. | Well I'm disputing the overhyped part. | Thx | What places do you like? | In comparison, look at how much food I get at a [different restaurant](https://i.ibb.co/thzB0zf/20241105-111903.jpg) for only about $29. | $6 is a bit pricey no? | Garbage? What's wrong with them? I love the...golden crust.

I will check out Jumeika | How so? They’ve been serving the exact same menu since they’ve opened. Meanwhile, even places like family meal at blue hill change seasonally. They haven’t even done seasonal drinks. | That’s fair. There’s nothing inventive about the dishes and the flavors can be found elsewhere in the city done better for cheaper. The drinks aren’t original or new takes or even consisting of interesting ingredients. | For sure, but I’m willing to pay for quality as long as it’s not outrageous. Everything is too expensive. | Low quality ingredients, mass produced | Menus don’t need to change all the time. How many visits will it take to try everything on the menu? | Yup, agree. There are dozens of better restaurants in the city. It’s a place to tell your friends you’ve eaten there and post on social media. Small portions, ridiculously priced. Mishmash of flavors but nothing really original. Had oxtail in Spain that was light years better and 1/5 the price. Have to scream over the music to be heard. Most people eating here have to tell themselves they had a fantastic experience to justify the mediocrity of the  food. | You could say that about fast food in general, that doesn't mean that McDonalds or Chipotle are trash | One or two. It’s not extensive or interesting. | Yes, this captures it exactly. | Do you remember the restaurant in Spain?? I’m so used to West Indian cooked ox tail. Heading to Spain next spring, I would love to try it. | Disagree! Different strokes… | If in Madrid, you can have good rabo de toro at Casa Dani. Bar Sal Gorda in Sevilla was also very good. Enjoy. | Fun thank you so much!! Oh my just looked them up they look incredible."
"iTaste-Express, the best ‘cheap American Chinese’ joint in the city (52 W 28th St)","Just discovered this place a few weeks ago, and I personally think that it’s one of the best ‘cheap greasy Chinese food’ restaurants in the city, maybe *the* best. 

- Great variety of side selections (fried rice, lo mein, pan fried noodles) and entree selections (ribs, pork chops, various styles of chicken/shrimp/steak/pork)

- The food actually tastes pretty good for what you’re getting 

- the serving sizes are huge relative to the price and when compared to other NYC locations at similar prices 

- Speaking of prices: 

$9.95 for 1 side + 1 entree (2-item combo)

$10.95 for 1 side + 2 entrees (3-item combo) 

$12.95 for 1 side 3 entrees (4-item combo)

As far as cheap Chinese goes, it doesn’t get better than this; my wallet and greasy cravings are very grateful to this restaurant. Here’s to hoping they maintain enough patronage.

","This is why I follow this sub | Forgot to mention that they also serve different styles of fish, and vegetable selections (salad, coleslaw, etc). | Is this lunch special pricing or the anytime price? | I appreciate your post, but you should be transparent that you're likely the business owner.


1) Same picture posted on Google from the business


2) Your photo is shot from the ""inside"" server side of the steam table. | [deleted] | I see plantains! | I feel like this should go here... To op and everyone else ever check out the documentary, ""the search for general tso"". If not it's pretty interesting. | I have to ask... is this a buffet where the food is open to the public for self service? | Thanks | I picked up a TGTG bag from here once. It's ok. I think it's  probably your best bet for affordable and somewhat authentic Chinese cuisine in the area. I even had braised pig feet in my container, which I wasn't expecting, but was pretty good! | https://www.itasteexpress.com | Looks good, will have to give a try. Thanks! | Not that I have any particular stake in this, but isn’t it just as likely that OP simply pulled the first photo off of Google because the average person (even if they’re espousing them) doesn’t take photos of random takeout restaurants? | Thank you. | Good eye | =) | I mean those places are better and more authentic yeah. But this is American Chinese food it’s basically an entirely separate cuisine | In addition to American Chinese being a different cuisine in my mind, I also feel like this place dishes out much larger portions. The plate size I get at iTaste is enough to last me 3 meals.

It’s like mall-Chinese food that costs a few dollars less. | best spot like that in chinatown? | Yeah honestly not really comparable. It’s like comparing Tex Mex and legit Mexican."
Getting back into dining at restaurants and feeling overwhelmed…,"Bit of a weird ask. Wife and I were really into going out to dinners fairly often and trying new restaurants. For a period in the last year or two, I felt like I was constantly getting let down, so we stopped exploring and honestly started getting more take out / counter service food.

Went to Long Island Bar for the first time on a whim a couple weeks ago, and we had such a nice dinner it sparked our desire to go out and try new places again.

The problem is, I’m so overwhelmed with places to try… I don’t even know where to start. Would love to hear anyone’s recommendations / favorites! For reference, we live in Williamsburg, so BK / Lower Manhattan is preferred. Basically looking for spots anywhere in the $100-200 range good for a date night dinner. More on the casual side is preferred. We love Leo, Maison Premiere, and Le French Diner for a little reference on the type of spots we like.","Sami and Susi | Am in the same area and some of my go to spots are: Kelloggs Diner, Esse Taco, High Lua, Afuri Ramen, Chez Ma Tante, Lori Jayne,  Wenwen, Win Son Bakery (specifically the bakery!)

I think you'd really like the recently reopened Kelloggs Diner | Thanks! Have been to Esse, Chez Ma Tante, and we love Win Son Bakery! I’ve been waiting for the Kelloggs hype to die down—I do want to try it. | Come have steak Frite and Buffalo 2.0 with us and tell us if Kelloggs hits, we’re curious too/looks bangin"

Weekend Dim Sum at 2pm?,"Thinking of going to dim sum at Golden Unicorn or Queens’ Asian Jewels or Congee Village, but I’m not sure we can make it until 2pm. Is it really slim pickings by then in these places?","Yes | We've done them at around 1-1:30pm and it was fine! 

Also, just to add, idk if Royal Queen at New World Mall is on your radar but I really recommend it. My family and I prefer it over Asian Jewels. | Dim sum = brunch. Best time to go is 10-10:30 am. | Dim Sum Palace is pricier but I had a great experience at 1pm on a Saturday ay their Division Street location. | Asian Jewels is my go to spot and usually if I go after 12 noon there aren't many choices left. | Golden Unicorn but Dim sum GoGo near by as a second choices. | As a rule of thumb, 3 PM is when it gets dangerous in terms of availability. | tim ho wan, dim sum palace | Dim Sum Palace serves dim sum well into late afternoon"

Best prime rib in NYC,"On the hunt for great prime rib. I’ve heard of Keen’s, Gallaghers and the Grill (also, 4Charles but honestly who is getting in there with a connect!). Which is your favorite, and do you have any more to add to the list?? We’re swinging into town next weekend, so probably too late for a reservation at this point, but we are going to try!","The kings cut at Keen's is spectacular, a massive hunk of meat. I typically opt for the Mutton, but my partner gets the prime rib and I have a few bites. Really cool atmosphere as well if you haven't been, with the old pipes all over and cool paintings | Benjamin might be in for a shout but it’s between the ones you’ve already singled out (never had one at Gallaghers, so can’t comment on that) | The Grill is by far the best. They even give you the bone which adds an extra level of awesome | Smith and Wollensky. But if money is not an issue then the Grill for sure. | Monkey Bar! Same as 4 charles | The Grill. End of message. | Maybe it's just the ambiance, but 4 Charles has been significantly better across on everything I've had at both"
Do people know about the pub menu at Keen's Steakhouse?,"When we asked for it, our waiter respectfully nodded his head and whispered, ""How did you hear about this?"" like we'd just unlocked some secret code. And yes, it was way cheaper than their regular menu and the burger and sirloin steak salad we ordered from it were both insanely good. Sure, we'll go back at some point to try the mutton and maybe an actual steak, but the night we went, the pub menu was perfect for us and I'm glad we knew about it.  ","They list it on their website so that’s a poorly kept secret. The waiter was joking around. | I had lunch there last week and they also have a “taste of the mutton” on the bar lunch menu which is a half-sized mutton chop. It was perfect! Medium rare btw | That's all I order from. The burger and fries is top notch. Go at dinner time and they give the veggies and that amazing blue cheese dressing and olives. 

I much prefer a hamburger to a steak and keens cooks it in the salamander so you get this amazing char. It's like.the burger is encrusted in burnt up beef and fat.

Also it's not a secret. It's on every table on a little stand next to the handles. Maybe your table didn't have one but when I've gone every table had it.

Anyway keens is for certain an amazing burger. I get it well done and it's so dry like a puck. love it. | Do you actually have to sit at their bar to order this? | The bar menu has a very good prime rib hash iirc. They used to bring out free meatballs to bar patrons around 8 pm but that was 15 years ago.  | I love eating at the bar and ordering the prime rib cut from that menu while basking in the glory of Ms. Keens. | Omfg which waiter was it? I used to work there and can imagine quite a few of them saying this lmao | The filet bites with mashed potatoes for $29.99 or whatever I think could honestly be the single best deal in the city | Shhhh…. | Hot take.  Keens is a 6 out of 10, best case scenario.  Mutton be damned. | Don’t be mean 😂 | That was my question. The mutton is amazing, but the portion (from the main menu) is huge. Good to see some attention being paid to this very underrated NY institution. | They have a taste of mutton on the regular menu. It’s literally the center in its own section with 1-2 other dishes. | >  an amazing burger. I get it well done and it's so dry like a puck. love it.

WTF?!  I don't know how to trust your opinion on anything after this. | Well done? Donald, is that you? 🤣 | incredible comment | Nope. We got it up in the Lincoln Room. Good thing because even though we normally prefer to eat at the bar, it was a frickin madhouse the night we went. | The hash is FANTASTIC | Hotter take, the mutton is 6 out of 10 but keens is a 10 out of 10. Vibe, history, service and learning that you can order off the pub menu in regular dining room. | You can order the Taste of mutton off the regular menu, it’s an appetizer. | The lunch mutton is the perfect portion size for me. | I was totally on board with what they were saying and then that made me question everything .. | I haven't had this feeling since the first time I ever read a comment that ended with Undertaker throwing Mankind | I’ve never heard of anyone being happy about the use of a salamanader before. | Happy cake  day ! | Then you've never heard someone talking about steakhouse steak.

Salamanders are great, super high heat so you can get an amazing crust WITHOUT horribly over cooking it.  It's pretty much the default.

That said, wood fired is also awesome, gods I hope St Anselm reopens..."
Best sit down Italian in Bushwick?,can be anything from fancy to super casual but I’m looking for something to go to on a Saturday night (ideally with a reservation) that is just great food. a nice vibe is awesome but that comes second on the list. thank you in advance! ,"Santa Panza | Probably too casual for your idea, it’s more of a counter, but Carmenta’s is awesome. Will never fail to recommend it here when I can, it’s the closest thing I have to a hidden gem in Brooklyn. | Big fan of Ops, although it's only pizza. Concrete is an Italian spot by Myrtle Ave Broadway, super friendly staff and generous portions, but the food isn't anything to wow you. I've really enjoyed Otis by the Morgan L stop. It's not Italian but they do have this braised pork pasta that was delicious but funky. Cool vibe there too. Also there is Carmenta's but that isn't really a sit down spot at all, even though they do have a few stools. Honestly I think you would have better options venturing towards Williamsburg. I haven't found a lot of Italian spots in Bushwick | bushwick robertas is pretty great. i know they’re mostly known for their pizzas but their pasta and entrees are really damn good too

and that straciatella 😮‍💨 | Santa Panza, Pan (on Decatur btwn wykoff and Irving), Roberta’s 

concrete is ok. The food is not that great. | Joe’s is an entirely unassuming super classic Italian spot and it’s soooooo good, tho it’s more in ridgewood! | Second on Otis. Not really Italian, but that pasta is 👌🏻"
Dead Rabbit,"If anyone frequents this place, amongst which menu items you like?","They're famous for their Irish coffee | Scotch Egg is good | Get their more complicated cocktails upstairs. Take your picks based on profiles you like. 

You can get their Irish coffee in a 2 minute wait at their spot at Moynihan, Irish Exit. | All of their food is great. The dry aged burger and the pot pies are my favorites. | Crispy pork belly sliders. | Pot pie! Must try. I also recently had a good pot pie at Champers and now am just craving pot pie all the time… | Their chicken fingers and sausage roll are 10/10 | They have excellent oysters. The happy hour is a steal but they’re worth it full price. | I opened this because it instantly made me crave their chicken pot pie! Had one last week and now I want it again. Lol. | Their tiramisu is my absolute favourite in all of nyc. 

Also their curried lamb Shepard’s pie | Had their Twilight Zone cocktail x2 last weekend. Gorgeous. | sparkle vegetable slim steep entertain rich like spark meeting nose

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* | Just went here last night! My partner and I’s favorite. The sliders are always a hit and if you like seafood - the chowder didn’t disappoint! 
Doctor’s Orders is my favorite cocktail there but upstairs the new take on New York sour with beets was really tasty as well. And you have to try the Irish coffee ofc. Just depends on what you like tbh. | Is it possible/easy to just walk in? | Best Irish coffee and best Guinness in New York City. I’m Irish, I know. For food the Irish breakfast, fish and chips, sausage rolls and toastie are all delicious and truly represent good Irish cuisine | Irish coffee is good. Menu changes from time to time but there are usually deviled eggs, which is my repeat order in the Parlor. | Used to go just for the lobster deviled eggs | So let's get one thing out of the way here, Dead Rabbit is two different bars, with different drink menus, under one roof. Not like, separate businesses or anything, but it's two different concepts. Downstairs is the more open pub-like atmosphere, and upstairs is the very serious experimental cocktail parlor. The parlor is what drove a lot of their hype in the bar world for many years.

Food wise, they aren't really anything special. I mean their stuff is good, but it's not anything to write home about. The Sunday roast is good if you go on Sunday. I know they have actual food, but honestly, I'd just get the snacks or oysters most times, the fries or the kerrygold popcorn are the better snacks IMO, good, but still standard bar food.

As for the drinks, it's been years since I've ordered from their downstairs drinks menu, and the upstairs menu changes every few months, so most advice isn't that useful. That said, the Kissa Tanto has been up for about a year now through a few parlor menu revisions and is one of my favorite things they've ever churned out. Super funky, and really worth it if you want to see how vegetal flavors can work in a drink in really unexpected ways.

The reason I haven't ordered from the downstairs menu in so long is that DR's real shining star has always been their encyclopedic knowledge and remarkable standardization of the hundreds of off-menu classics that they still put a unique spin on, so if you know cocktails enough to have some off-the-beaten-path classics that you know and love, there's no reason at all to stick to the small menu downstairs. The menu is small for that reason, you're meant to just sort of order whatever you want. 

This was, for a very long time, my usual haunt in the city, and for a long time was my favorite bar in the world. They aren't all that they used to be but it's still overall extremely good. | Great cocktails in general but the Irish coffee is the best in the world | Do you just go upstairs or do I need a reservation? | Haven't had pot pie in over a decade honestly, probably more. Really inclined to give it a twirl, thank you | Some of the best sausage rolls in nyc | May try it too since you coming back again for this lol | Just was there Friday w husband for pre-party drink. Arrived at 6, seated immediately upstairs (Parlor).  For the hour we were there, it was busy but not to capacity. | I haven't made a reservation here in a few years, and I've never had to wait in that time unless I was specifically trying to get into the parlor, and even then the longest I've had to wait was 20 minutes. Just avoid peak time on Saturday early evening and you'll be good. | I’m not usually an Irish coffee person but I turn into one when I’m there. | I just tell the host I'm going upstairs and wait. I'm sure you can try to see if they do reservations. | Tis the season!"

Atomix -  Price Increase for December,"Well another month with no success in scoring a reservation but did notice that the prices have increased for December.  
  
Chefs table from $395.00 to $450.00 and the Bar $270.00 to $320.00","I believe the price increase is only for the December menu which is slightly different than the regular menu. Goes back to regular price in January. | Was there back in June. It was the most disappointing fine dining experience for me. Could not understand the hype. | It's rare but they Increase the price sometim3s. It might always be in December. | If there is more demand than supply then the price is too low 🤷‍♂️ | It happened last year as well. Probably the ingredients and extra holiday demand. | yeah am looking to book as well! | We went on Wednesday. In retrospect, I would have happily paid that much. | Im pretty sure the December menu has auto added truffle or caviar and an extra dish for holiday season and thats why the price is increased. It will probably go back down for January. I know this was true in i want to say 2022. | I got a res in Dec and rolled my eyes when I saw this at checkout. 

Some folks here saying the Dec menus are more luxurious and I'd certainly hope so. | Got a reso for bar tasting on December 3rd At 9:15 For 2 people. Had planned a NYC trip but sadly cancelled. DM me for face-value sale and transfer via tock. | Saw that! I, too, was beaten by the bots :(  Looking for Bar Tasting for 3 Dec 11th | rainstorm cooperative shame head enter ten smile roll memorize worm

 *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)* | What are one or two places you think were impressive fine dining and why didn't Atomix live up to that? | Agreed. It wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the price and the hassle of trying to get a reservation. I thought jungsik was better, and much more ""affordable"" | Agreed - very disappointing given the hype and the price point. There was one fish dish that was actually inedible for me. | But they let you select your own chopsticks, isn’t that good enough lmao | No?

Do you support corporations doing the same?

A place can be good, popular, and have good prices. I don't get why this sub is against average people being able to afford nice restaurants. | I would pay it happily if I could ever get in. | Being Korean I really loved bom. And Odo for Japanese. | I tried a new place called corima last week; elevated Mexican cuisine and the tasting menu was $110 (I think). Everything was amazing from begging to end | I recommend Frevo, Le Bernadin, or Chefs Table. Those three to me were the best Michelin restaurants I’ve been to. Granted how chefs table lost all its stars. Cote is also pretty good given the price for the butchers feast. | 100% agree. Jungsik is significantly better | The moment I walked in, they were giving us dashida soup tasting. Dashida is basically MSG, so we were doing MSG soup tasting to start. Also didn't see the point of choosing our own chopstick when we can't even take it home. What's the point? | 1. Keep checking on the reservations thread here and on r/finedining. These reservations come up regularly. 

2. If you remind me closer to the date, tell me how many people you want a reservation for and I'm happy to try on your behalf. Don't worry - will transfer through Tock for the exact price. Just want to help other people try the experience and I have a good track record of getting reservations. | I've been to odo recently and also left very impressed. Note that there are two areas of this restaurant, the front which is very cramped and then the back which is extremely pleasant. | Of those, I’ve only been to LB.

World class service and atmosphere was expensive but the food wasn’t amazing to me. | Went to Cesar last week and it was very good, best meal I've had in NYC so far. | Whatever impresses the tech bros I guess lol | And? What’s the issue with MSG soup tasting, besides your own ignorance? | That's very kind of you. Right now I have been looking for Friday 11/8 at anytime and Saturday 11/9 late seating just for myself. When i didn't luck out today for December I decided to book a trip to Ireland instead. :) | I’ve been scouring all the sales threads - hoping to get Bar Tasting for Dec 11 for 3 people (seems like there was a block on 12,13,14 weekend?) | What didn’t you like about the food? 

Probably the finest example of haute French seafood in the world. | Oh! If you're a single diner, I highly suggest you just call directly and see if they can accommodate."
Manhatta: one of the best “rooftop” dining experiences in NYC,"Go for lunch. Manhatta is more approachable and low key at this hour. And unlike many rooftop or penthouse restaurants, the food is actually decent (but unremarkable). 

Drinks are solid. But the views… incredible.

The northern exposure views of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and even some of the Bronx on a clear day are basically unmatched. There are few tall buildings to rival or block its view. And given its positioning so far south in Manhattan, you get to soak in practically everything uptown.

Great experience.

It's a fave for taking out of town visitors, and don't sleep on the burger at the bar, one of the best in Manhattan. | It’s wild because I just came from there for lunch. I agree the views are beautiful but I found the food extremely underwhelming and left disappointed. | Love this place 10x more than 2 Michelin star Daniel… we went within a month of each other… I kinda wanted to go back to Manhatta since we loved it so much but wanted to try a “classic” we have never been to. The only bad side it’s a bad in the ass to get to from midtown but that’s a minor quibble | What’s the dress code/ expected dress like | I went to Manhatta for a solo lunch on my birthday! They gave me such princess treatment, and the views were fabulous, was such a special treat for myself. | [Ophelia](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/380863362289689/ophelia/?hl=en) has a great view! | when i went in the spring i thought the food was very good. maybe not, like, surprising but excellent | Was one of my fav spots. Was even better before Covid. Love the no tipping policy (unless they changed that too) | Worked in this building when Manhatta opened. Happy hours on the company dime were epic times. | Good views but overrated food. | What's your chance of getting a seat by the window to fully enjoy the view while you eat? | I love Manhatta lunch!! Great views, great more reasonable lunch, great service! One of my favorite restaurants | Manhatta was built for the catered events on the other side of the floor. The half open kitchen is on the restaurant side since its not as appealing to have guests in formal wear so close to it. So when stuff feels like an afterthought there its because it is. | Went there with my wife for our anniversary. Unfortunately it was a gray, drizzly evening and you could only see like 6” outside the window. Fortunately we’d taken an edible before heading out, so we both found it hilarious and had a good time with dinner and cocktails while we intermittently cracked up about the view we’d splurged for. | I hear there is a restaurant in the works at Water Street Projects. [https://www.instagram.com/wsanyc/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/wsanyc/?hl=en) | My office used to be in the floor below the restaurant, looking out toward the Statue of Liberty. The view is truly incredible. | When there for my anniversary this week.. amazing. True for me it is 2star level | The burger at the bar is a great lunch 

Top 5-10 burger in NYC imo  | Can this compete with Saga?

Never been to either one | Manhatta also overworks their employees and half the staff has quit over the past year making it even worse. 

Decent view but the food/drinks are definitely mediocre | I will be working remotely next week and wondered if it would be weird to work with my laptop while eating there? | Simply the best dining experience I've had in NYC, beats every Michelin restaurant I've been to by miles | River cafe at night view is better. | The burger is good?! I was deterred from getting it not only by the inflated price but the overall uninspiring menu (so my wife and I just ordered a bunch of appetizers plus the farro for lunch, which was all decent). Good to know though - I’ll try it next time!

Definitely going back for drinks. | I've been a couple times for lunch. The burger was surprisingly good. It may still be a bit overpriced, but that view is worth it alone. | Agree completely. Great spot for a special occasion if the other person cares more about views/atmosphere than the food. I think the food was just ok but I'll be back for sure. | If you want a “classic” 2-star experience that won’t disappoint on the food side, try Gabriel Kreuther. | Daniel is very, very old school. Not really in a good way, unless you love fustiness. | You can get there very easily from midtown.  Almost every subway line stops nearby. | Smart casual. | It's not that serious | Great when in Midtown! | They ask for tip (and 20% was the recommended minimum with many other higher options) | Very good actually. Had no problem, although I did go for lunch of a weekday (Halloween though!). But the reservations are wide open, so I think it's true for most days. | Views wise, yes. Food, drink and service wise, no. | I would think so, I've only ever been in the evening but the vibe didn't seem conducive to remote work. | Just leave the laptop behind for an hour. | Burger is FANTASTIC. Definitely worth getting. Great cocktails too. | I just had the burger and thought it was flavorless to be honest. I’m annoyed that I paid for it. But agree the views are nice. | lol. Yes, the burger is good. | The burger is excellent, its only rivals in Manhattan are the Minetta Black Label and Emily WV Emmy Burger, IMO. | Who is your favorite for food/drink/service?"

Looking for a rec near MSG,"Hey, myself and a couple buddies are going to a ranger game after work. We typically default to keen’s for dinner before a game but are looking for an alternative. Recently went to The Grill before a game and missed half of the first period despite doing a 5pm reservation. So I’m looking for a keen’s alternative that is walking distance from the garden. Doesn’t have to be steak. Open to anything. Only requirements are that the food be really good/great and close enough to the garden to get there in time for puck drop. Thanks in advance. ","Jongro in Koreatown | The new Roberta's across from MSG is awesome. Not just for pizza either, Really great new mains and salads, veggies etc. Also the roof last night was warm and not too crowded! Also the food and drinks came out super fast! | Hey Yuet (Cantonese), w 26th |  Cafe china, zou zou’s, ci Siamo | Haymaker. | Tavola | Haymaker on 29th and 8th is great for beer. I haven't eaten a ton there but what I've had has been solid. | Milo’s Hudson yards | Bar primi | Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill is new, good and literally across the street. | 10-15 minute walk from MSG but Koloman is ridiculously good | Keens is 100% walking distance from the garden it’s on like 35th and 6th i’m pretty sure | Din tai fung | I’ll second ci Simao. | Ci siamo is overrated now | I’m going to haymaker in about half an hour


If you’re looking for a full sit down steak dinner, Wolfgang’s on park or Rocco’s on Madison. Both a bit farther but walking distance. Wolfies standard steakhouse. Rocco’s is a spinoff from some of the old Wolfgang’s guys. Steakhouse + Italian.

GL | Went the other day and it was just a lovely ad a couple years ago | Where was that a requirement of the posters request? | he said him and his buddy’s are going after work and last time they went somewhere at 5pm they missed half of the first period so yeah if they want to din tai fung after work they’d miss the whole game"
Recommend me good food for post nyc marathon!,"Hi I’m running the nyc marathon and would love to reward myself w my dad through a fancy filling lunch after. 

Could you give ur best recommendations based on the following?
- near lower side of Central Park (ends in w 66th)
- lots of quantity with high quality proteins/carbs (need to devour a lot!) that is delicious!
- prefer a place I can reserve in advance with less wait time 
- not a fan of fish, but no dietary restrictions!
- place that wouldn’t mind me showing up in my run clothes m
- no budget (I’m willing to treat myself, but don’t HAVE to go to a fancy place; a $20 burger will do good too if u want to recommend)

Thank you so much!!💚",quality meats / eats | Salumeria Rosi | Quality Bistro — get the butter board! | I suggest Serafina on Broadway and 77th. Reliable. Very good pasta. Other choices.  (I’ve taken my daughter after west side soccer in cleats.) Good luck!
Roast my itinerary- 2.5 days in NYC,"First trip to NYC! Girlfriend & I are both excited to make this a food trip.

We'll be splitting most everything, walking a ton, and veggie diet clensing for like a month after lol

Feel free to provide alternative options, although the 'route' for the day is mostly set, so ill be more likely to consider if the alternate is close to one of the other locations (or the original planned location), as these stops are listed in order of visiting which I feel is well planned. Or, if missed any NYC staple foods, let me know as well!

Day 1:

* Laguardia, through times square, up to Barney Greengrass for mixed smoked fish app platter, garlic Bialy & Latkes. Cel-ray/black cherry soda & a black & white.
* Levian bakery OG location a few blocks south. Meh? only stopping cause its close
* Grays papaya, lol
* Central park walk around, bethesda terrace, etc etc
* Los tacos #1 near times SQ for the especial adobada & convenience of location (will spend like 30 mins in time square) also, if theres any cool **small** **bites** in central midtown on the walk down id appreciate it!
* Joes pizza on broadway just cause of how close it is
* South to Ktown, for Grace st mini cheesecake, Hokkaido cheese tart, perhaps woorijip/E-mo
* Teso life or similar shops for knick knack souvenirs (were both only bringing backpacks so not room for much)
* Potentially a little take out order from sushi 35 west
* Back north to Omusubi Gonbei / Sunrise mart
* Bryant park winter market thing
* Top of the rock for nighttime city views, head home after

Day 2:

* Astoria ferry to Roosovelt island, walk around, tram thing to Manhattan
* Mcsorleys? is it dumb to want one of their hot dogs sober? they look good lol
* Russ & daughters pastrami salmon
* South to chinatown, Double Crispy bakery for egg tart? better ones? Tasty dumpling, golden steamer, really arent hard set on these in Chinatown we'll just grab what looks good.
* Xian famous food lamb burger to-go for the next stop
* Staten island ferry round trip cause its cheaper than the ferry tours
* Not sure if theres anything else important to see/eat in south manhattan/financial district from my limited research.
* Wall st->dumbo ferry, walk brooklyn bridge back (girlfriend demands it)
* Scarrs pizza near chinatown on way back up to Houston st? people seem to really dislike it here so might skip it
* Katz>2nd st it seems, might split a half sandwhich with matzah ball soup at this point in the day.
* Potentially Rosella/Shinzo for dinner if its still early enough and we can walk around/shop first.

Day 3:

* Subway to Breakfast @ Balthazar? Ive seen some people say its fell off on this sub, but how bad can you mess up breakfast? its still an institution and I think GF would like Ambiance, but im willing to listen to alternatives.
* Subway to williamsburg, Win-son bakery (girlfriend really wants it) for some baked goods, maaaybe the veg scallion sando
* Peter luger lunch special burger, no fries no toppings
* L'industrie, fini & best pizza quick 'pizza tour'
* Any other williamsburg shopping/attractions cant miss while were over here?
* Rosella/shinzo, still deciding as theres like a 95% chance we wont do it for dinner day 2. too much food lol

Thanks for reading & your feedback!","Staten Island ferry is free, you’ll get stopped by a bunch of fake ticket sellers, do not stop or talk to them just enter the ferry terminal and walk upstairs | You really need to plug your paths into GMaps and look at how much time you're spending traveling.  While what you've got is technically possible, it's pretty scattershot, and you're going to spend a lot of time just traveling to your destinations.  While some of that travel is cool, a lot of it's going to be just schlepping. I empathize with your desire to DO ALL THE THINGS! but I suspect you're spreading yourself too thin (or maybe y'all are long distance hikers and this is a light load for your normal day, I just want to make sure you're going in with eyes open).

There's very little on your list I'd say ""Don't do that, do this"" my one point would be McSorley's.  If you want to go there for the history/ambiance, do it (get a beer or 2, and go do something else).  If you're legit thinking of going there for food? Please don't.  You can get just as good a hotdog from your local grocery store, just like them.  It's one of the best neighborhoods for food and drink in NYC, your stomach space is better spent elsewhere.

While in KTown you should go through Food Gallery 32, good option for small things.  At Grace St I encourage you to get the plain cheesecake, not the chocolate/matcha, I think all of the burnt flavor gets overpowered otherwise.

Going from EV -> Chinatown, stop at Carnitas Ramirez.  The Surtida is the best 'I only have room for one taco' option as it has a bit of everything on the pig (alternatively get your favorite cut).  Maybe also pick up something to eat on the line outside of Katz's depending on when you get there ;P

On one of your passes by Bryant park I'd encourage you to go into the Library, say hi to the lions, do the tourist thing and go see the Rose Reading Room (just be quiet) where Ghostbusters was shot.

PS: Good job on the formatting this time ;P | **Day 1:**

If you're going to stop by OG or Upper West side Levain's, you should definitely stop by [Janie's Life Changing Baked Goods](https://maps.app.goo.gl/T1bAxosHiuyEiHgMA). Janie's have these delicious pie crust cookies that you can't really get anywhere else so it's unique and delicious. 

There's also a few more good cookie spots in that area, enough to do a mini cookie tour if you want. 

[William Greenberg Dessert](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QRtTByGxKYvtaKbV9) is known for their black and white cookie. (it was good, but I don't eat black and white cookies that often to confidently declare that they're the ""best"" lol)

Chip City and Crumbl is also nearby (not a recommendation, I haven't had either yet).

\---

I would do a HARD skip on Woojirip. It's fine as a cheap Korean takeout lunch spot for the locals working in the area but if you're a tourist, it's a waste of a meal especially when there's so much good food in Korea Town. If given the choice, I'd pick E-mo for kimbap over Woojirip any day.

I also like [Bibble and Sip](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zSdzNoQXeduPLPkh8) as a really cute bakery. They have fancy ""modern"" cream puffs and these really freaking cute bite size cakes and desserts. 

I always see a long ass line at the Joes and Los Tacos at Times Square because it's tourist central. There's like a ton of Joes and Los Tacos locations in the city now and I'd say that these two are the worst locations because of the lines. They BOTH have locations in the Financial District on Day 2. IMO it's probably better to go to the FIDI location instead, especially since FIDI is a food desert and doesn't have that many great food options.

\---

I would probably skip Teso Life snacks and get the snacks at Sunrise Mart or Katagiri (Omusubi Gonbei is inside Katagiri). IDK which has better snacks but I rather support local store rather than a chain grocery store with a million locations. | Katz’s, Russ and Daughters, and Barney Greengrass seem like a lot of the same type of food for such a short space of time. | how many stomachs do you have? b/c there is no way you are eating this much food in single 8-12hr period. even if you split it. | Skip Roosevelt island. Bring cash for e-mo. | Amazing research. Seems ambitious. Teim a little. Skip Peter Luger. The Wall St to Dumbo Ferry is very short. Maybe just walk the bridge once and do BB Park (massive Time Out food hall there). Kogane (ramen), Montague Diner, and L’Appartment bakery in Brooklyn Heights are good food options. The Heights is gorgeous to walk through. Consider the Wall St to Red Hook ferry and eat at Homestead BBQ (try Jamaican spicy ribs and cornbread). | I don’t wanna be your toilet on day 4. | Instead of McSorley's, go to Crif Dogs for a hot dog. McSorley's is fun for drinking beer, but only if it's not crowded. 

For your Williamsburg day, a few ideas: 
* Check out the waterfront - some really nice parks & great view of the city
* Depending on when you go, you could wander up to Greenpoint to check out a couple of other social media famous places like Cafe Panna, Peter Pan Bakery, Taqueria Ramirez, or Radio Bakery. | Day 2 has a LOT of ferries and I don't know if you're taking into account travel times.

I don't find Roosevelt Island very appealing, but if you do I would suggest moving it to Day 3 instead and doing Tram to Roosevelt Island, Astoria Ferry to 34th St/transfer to East River Route to Williamsburg. This does mean skipping Balthazar, so up to you. | Spicy Village is good for Xian type food in Chinatown. I crave it big time. | Get the Liang Pi at Xi'an instead. Completely different dish and requires utensils to eat but I never get the lamb burger there. Unless you definitely must have it, then get both :) | Don't bother with Astoria ferry/Roosevelt island. There's not much to see on Roosevelt island. If you really really want to go there for down reason then go at night to the Panorama Room. Great rooftop hotel bar with amazing views. | Katz's deli always has a long line. I was just there around 5 pm on a Monday and the line was half the block. 

you have quite a packed schedule ! Might be worth it to leave some time to wander around in each area rather than spending a lot of time traveling from place to place. (ex; getting the Hokkaido cheese cake for takeout and walking around K-town!) | Skip the Bryant park winter market! Insanely expensive / crowded and the food isn’t good | How much food can you eat in a day!?! | You better hope that there are no delays! Even to walk around takes some time. I def. Agree with plugging this into a maps app to get a better picture of how long it’s gonna take you to get around. 

Because you also have to factor in the wait times for both the food and for transportation. | One thing I want to point out is that you should definitely walk the Brooklyn Bridge starting in Brooklyn and walking into Manhattan, the view is 10000x better that way. I think that's how you have it planned right now but just wanted to flag that it's not the same experience going the other way, so keep that part the way you have it! Ideally at dusk as the lights come on | just near McSorley's  which is AWESOME... is a location of mamoun's falafel (love me some mamoun's), would do that instead of a McSorley's hotdog...  if not the old school McSorley's cheddar/crackers/onion plate been around for 100 years..   BTW 100% gray's papaya for the dogs | i used to live on roosevelt island, you’re wasting time by going there tbh | Shocking to me people still wanna try Joes it's so painfully mid and sweet. you have a much better pizza day lined up in williamsburg lol. Might be worth adding Ace's over best pizza IMO but up to you | Balthazar is a vibe, but not sure if it's worth a dedicated trip to Soho. If you ditch Roosevelt Island maybe hit Balthazar before Chinatown. They're very close. Or, go late night for a glass of wine and moules frites. 25 years ago that was one of my favorite things to do.

Some may say it's over hyped, but I think Dominique Ansel is very good. Haven't been in a while, but the DKAs, Madeleines and egg sandwiches were my faves.  Not sure what the weekend lines are like though. | If you’re going to be near Katz’s Yonah Schimmel is the original iconic knish place 

Also when you take the Staten Island ferry, look for the fish carousel in the park next door (I can’t remember the actual name but it’s amazing). | Stay away from Balthazar it’s crowded and bland at this point. Cute but not worth it at all. Sad. 

Joes is fine but John’s on bleeker and Prince street are better. If you can make to Brooklyn Julianna’s or Difara are your better options. 

Coffee and breakfast at maman is a must. 

Au chaval for their burger and Mac and cheese. 

Don Angie for some incredible food. Everything is good. Known for lasagna. - wait outside before they open. 

Tompkins square bagels. 

Most importantly. Most most most.   Clinton street baking company for breakfast. I promise you. It’s worth it. Have fun. | I love the hotdog at McSorley’s, but the mustard is a bit sharp for me. You do need to have a beer with it. | Maybe something from Cuba, DR, or Jamaica. If you like carbs patty on coco bread is my current obsession. I love the fried chicken sandwiches from Tina’s and Sophie’s. Get plantains added. | Here’s a few places I went to on my last trip to NyC:

-Lella Alimentari in Brooklyn for their piadine

-Adels Halal cart for the chicken over spicy rice

-chicken pot pie at Dead Rabbit

-Lafayette Bakery for the pistachio round croissant
 
-Janie’s Life Changing pie crust cookies | I would walk the Brooklyn bridge and eat at timeout market and take ferry back to wall st from dumbo. It’s a short ride … literally like one stop then walk down to SI ferry. Makes more sense logistically to save time vs the other way around. 

 - skip woorjip  
- go west village and do pizza tour. Highly recommend lindustrie, mama toos, johns of bleecker (don’t think they sell by the slice though) 
- Chinatown (mei lei wah roast pork buns, lots of bubble tea spots like chicha San Chen, mochi donuts and cream puffs from alimama, soup dumplings at noodle village  

If you’re doing Russ and daughters, do that route along with Scarrs and Katz. Scarrs is solid but not my favorite. Scarrs would be the last stop in your LES tour before you head to Chinatown 

Fidi: oculus, Brookfield, WTC memorial pools, lady M, Eataly, Beard Papas (just opened), Tin Building, Seaport. If you do Tin Building and Seaport is along the same pathway to the ferry port 

Hope this helps! 

PS - lived here all my life and I never been to Roosevelt Island. There’s nothing there that has appealed me to go. Personally would skip if you’re only here for so long. | Damn that is a lot of eating, but I like how much of the city you are covering. I like that you are doing ferry, tram, walking the Brooklyn Bridge etc. You're going to see the city in a specialy way that most tourists don't. 

Things that I would recommend skipping: Katz's is overpriced, long wait, you can get better food elsewhere; just look in the window and you can get a feel for what it's like. Peter Luger is overhyped, but maybe that burger is good; the ambiance is ZERO, the staff are rude, and the food is mid. You can get great burgers all over the city. | Day 3

Winson Bakery is popping up at Vallata on E19th St in the Flatiron district until Dec 2024. If your trip is soon that makes it easier and you could skip Luger and the entirety of Brooklyn that day to minimize travel. 

Pastis has a similar vibe to Balthazar and you can share their burger between 2 people for $30 or so. The food at Balthazar isn’t great. You can also try Au Cheval, Monkey Bar, 4 Charles Prime Rib, Emily (West Village), Gotham Burger Social Club, Nowon, Minetta Tavern or one of the many other bougie burgers on Manhattan to replace Luger. 

You can replace the Williamsburg pizza tour with a West Village / Manhattan one easily. If you want bagels on Manhattan there’s plenty of popular spots based on the style you like. | Firstly well done for doing such extensive research. NY is a melting pot so the choices can be overwhelming for sure.

As many others have pointed out this is a rather ambitious itinerary both from a timing as well as a waistline perspective.

I've got a few questions before I provide any suggestions.
1. How have you determined your food list? Is it based on budget friendly, must do lists, particular cuisines you like or are lacking where you live? If cuisines might be helpful if you could share these
2. Is cost a factor ie do you have a daily budget at all?
3. Would you rather maximise your amounts of eats vs waiting at the popular places for the experience and the food?
4. Would you prefer to spend all your time going from food to food venues or have some touristy/cultural activities? 
5. What hours are you planning on being awake on these days? | I just want to say Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tart sucks imo.

Also some of the places you want to go the lines are crazy long and time consuming. | For your Williamsburg day, Qawwah house has good coffee and sweets. I’d skip Peter Luger | Los Tacos No 1 kinda sucks. Taqueria Ramirez al pastor is 10 times better | your schedule just seems way too packed. are you sure you can eat that much?

Joe's quality has gone downhill massively, I'd skip if you're heading to the other spots listed. That specific los tacos has given me food poisoning once. The tacos are good for nyc, but not amazing if you've been to CA or Mexico. 

not a huge cookie guy, but I think levain is overhyped. I'd rather go to lady m for sweets

the papaya dog places are just named that for the papaya juice, the hotdogs are nothing special. If you want a hot dog go to Nathans. 

top of rock, make sure it's not rainy or low clouds otherwise you won't see anything

skip mcsorleys 

Out of the touristy spots, don't skip Katz's. Just go there instead of russ | Your itinerary looks like it was written by a tour group.  Don’t forget to say hi to the Statue of Liberty! | Thank you for your feedback! I definitely hear you about the traveling thing, that’s kind of why I’ve been planning this trip is meticulously compared to any other location. Feels like you need to have activities in each part of the city so you’re not on the subway half the day.\

Speaking on that, we can walk a lot. Thinking about it now, I feel like that’s a big part of it? We won’t want to spend a ton of time in touristy areas, and I feel like it’ll help fill the day, see more & make us feel better to eat more food. I’m sure more than a few locations will get skipped on the way though.\

Ittl be interesting once I’m actually there because we might find so much cool stuff naturally that our plans get completely thrown, I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t any point we had no plans. I feel like that’d be a bit overwhelming first time in the city! Also hoping /u/garconavecunreve appreciates the formatting lol | **Day 2:**

There's really not that much to do on Roosevelt Island once you're there. You can walk south and hit up some WW2 memorial at the southern tip of the island (note that it's closed on Tuesdays for whatever reason) but its not that interesting. It's a nice good walk if it's like Spring/Fall on a good day but it will probably be cold and windy as fuck in the Winter.

The Tram is worth taking for the cheap view, but I would probably just take the subway back from Roosevelt Island into Manhattan.

\---

FIDI is known to be a food desert. I would strongly recommend to eat in Chinatown rather than look for good food in FIDI. If you do want to eat in FIDI, see earlier comment about Los Tacos and Joe's.

Here's also a older comment that I made for [""small eats"" in Chinatown](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/uvejl1/comment/i9li61p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Not saying Double Crispy is bad but [DineEnBlanc posted a thread on egg tarts earlier this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bh5usq/a_tasting_of_egg_tarts_part_3/) if you want to go through your egg tart options lol.

\---

Some stuff that I think you should visit:

[9/11 memorial ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nwejjs1KWUPZzD2V7)is a must visit for me as it's a beautifully well made and a truly unique spot in the city. Its eerily somber, quiet and beautiful when you're there and it goes back to the usual NYC hustle and bustle as soon as you're a block away from it. Definitely worth visiting even if you don't plan on paying for the museum.

Across the street from the memorial is the [Oculus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a4sAqs8iYZxjQ9k3A) building. It's like a giant high end mall/transportation hub in a cool building, worth a quick 10 min walk through since it's across the street.

Right behind the memorial is Brookfield Place. Another dumb mall BUT the mall has a really nice, [chill backyard marina/dock area facing towards the river](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K8Dp6ewdzsKbcnab7) in the Spring-Fall. In the winter they have a [skating rink set up](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fS7CK2DUEUDigEw6).

There's also a [Eataly](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9raU6nPJadbWyR8a8) near the memorial. It's a Italian market, might be worth a walkthrough if you want some Italian pastries or small eats. There's also a [Lady M outpost](https://maps.app.goo.gl/d9yjAuTP1Gd3ndYo9) in this mall and they're known for their crepe cakes. | Thank you sooooooo much!
I’m going to take most of these into account I think.
I’ve realized I can get joes & los tacos basically anywhere, anytime I visit the city, so they’ll likely be the first that get skipped.

I forgot about the 9/11 memorial & occulus, those both seem worth seeing. 
The other bakeries and spots I will be fitting into the plan now! 
You’re right about the Ktown spots, I just tried shoving plans in while I’m there but it’s only like a 10 min walk detour so I’ll just hit the bakeries & be on my way. 
Thanks again! | +1 for pie crust cookie | If you go to Janie’s walk a block down to see the Banksy there, pretty cool. | If you’re going to be near K | You are probably right. Katz order would be half pastrami sandwich, though, so not too similar but still deli food I guess. 
Russ & daughters might be swapped for a place with better bagels, whichever one we pass. It’s mainly the historical side for a tourist like me that made R&D appealing. Plus, pastrami salmon sounds good lol | I’ll post a follow up with all the pictures of food that I see a lot on this sub, we will see😆 | I’m mainly just doing it to ride the tram. Is it not cool? I’m willing to skip it | Depending on where OP is from, they might get better BBQ at home. I'm not sure I'd recommend a first timer go all the way down to Red Hook for that. | I mean Hometown BBQ | Ambitious in terms of quantity of food, number of destinations around the city or both? We’re good walkers, and coming from high elevation to sea level will help.
Also, thank you! This is the most excited I’ve been for a trip in awhile. No other cities in the US would have me doing research the way New York does. | 😆 I also have a hard time going while traveling so we’ll see! LOL | Thank you so much, I’ll look into these today! | Shit I didn’t think about that. Roosevelt island is only cause I’m staying in Astoria & I could take the ferry there & then the tram to midtown quickly, but I’m happy to skip it. Seemed like a cool thing to do with the GF, though | Second spicy villager. Would skip xian lol | Great tip, thanks! I just picked the lamb burger randomly off the menu so It’s not a must get | Dang I was going to go on a Sunday or Monday. Maybe a bit later than 5pm though. If I break my plans because of wandering or whatever I won’t be upset.
Also is it crazy to think the schedule isnt too packed for waking up early and staying in the city until like 10pm? We’ll see I guess😆 | In one sitting- actually less than the average person my girlfriend can eat way more than me. I’m more of a grazer/snacker. 
You’ll notice not many of these places are sit down restaurants, and splitting a pastry/taco/piece of pizza isn’t much food, the list looks less intimidating lol | This was put into maps😅 you’re the 2nd person to say that so maybe I’m missing something. Seem to have no crazy long walks or stops that are far from subways. I don’t mind spending extra $$ taking subways in ways that might seem inefficient to a local, if it lets me see more. Hopefully that makes sense | Correct, we’d be taking the ferry to dumbo and then walking back to manhattan! Dusk sounds really nice. | Cliches are cliches for a reason, lol. Just felt like the touristy thing to do but decent chance I’ll skip it | yeah skip joe's, not worth it at all unless you just wanna say you've been there. | Shit you’re right, I didn’t realize how close it was to Chinatown. On their website we could only get reservations for Monday, can we just wait in person for a table in your experience? 

We might switch around what day we go now that you suggest it. Just so happens my Gf favorite food is mussels so funny you mention it! | Any favorite at Clinton st bakery? Looks interesting. Also, is Tompkins st good just a bagel with cream cheese? I’ve avoided putting many bagel places on the list because a big breakfast sandwich or lox & the works is pretty stomach filling | What pizza shops in the WV area would u recommend? I’d have to plan a new route but I’d be willing to | Hello! Thanks for commenting. I’m happy to get smacked in the face with reality, but it doesn’t seem unrealistically ambitious to me. We’ll be in bed early each night and up early each day.

Most important thing is a food trip for stuff that nyc does best, with some personal preferences sprinkled in(see win son). 

I’m going to be splitting everything with my partner, we’ll be walking a lot, not a lot of sit down restaurants so just small bites.

No real budget. I mean I don’t plan on spending a ridiculous amount unless I alter the plan majorly.

We have rosella reservation @ 5 on day 3 and broadway tickets at 7, besides that and top of the rock, and a Times Square (quick) walk through, no real tourist-y stuff. 

I know Katz can have a big line, and Russ & daughters on Sunday morning might have a big line, but I don’t expect to wait in line for much of any other place. Could be totally wrong though. | Besides Russ & daughters, Katz & perhaps some of the places listed near time square(which I might skip or go to other locations) which places have a long queue in your experience? | I got the runs once from no 1 so I'd say in that regard pretty authentic! | FIDI is hardly a food desert (although it may have been more so in the past). Takahachi Bakery, Dead Rabbit, Xi'an Famous Foods Fidi, Crown Shy, Da Claudio, Harry's Italian, many others. Not saying that these are all destination restaurants, but it most certainly isn't a food desert. | A few more things:

For Katz, try to go for self service instead of table service. Ordering from the meat counter is part of the Katz experience. You can tip the cutters a few bucks and they'll give you some samples of the meat. 

They set aside only a few tables for table service so in my experience, self service line moves MUCH faster than the table service line.

If there's a day with bad weather, you can make Day 1 the backup plan for bad weather. The Museum of Natural History is right where Janie's/Levain's/Gray's Papaya is so you can still knock out some stuff on your list and spend the afternoon indoors at the museum. | Other ways to fit in Los Tacos while avoiding Times Square location: the Grand Central one is near Bryant Park; the Penn Station one is near K-town; there’s one 10 mins walk from Balthazar. | Joes and Los Tacos are really good, though | If the timing works out (and you don't plan on going to the museum) I recommend going to the 9/11 memorial at night. The lighting is really special. | i mean, if you both are incredibly fit and have fast metabolism, then maybe. but even half a katz sandwich and a side, and im done. lol | I mean, I don’t want to yuck your yum if you love trams. But to me, personally, I wouldn’t waste the time for a tram ride. | Tram is cool...  but so many things in the city are cool...   gotta choose, personally I really like the tram | the Tram is TOTALLY worth it! | ...where in Astoria? We don't have many hotels, and the ones we do aren't near the ferry terminal. You should just take the subway | get both. you have to get noodles if you go there | No idea what the breakfast rush is like. I walk by most  mornings, so I know that there are always outside tables available, but then you don't get the full experience.
To clarify, we would go to the bar late night for wine + mussels. But that was decades ago so maybe just check the kitchen hours to make sure. | Clinton is one of those places that knocks breakfast out of the park. Typically with their pancakes, they are fluffy, fruit compote if you like, incredible food. But all of their food is incredible each menu item. Bacon is delicious and cooked right, drinks, it’s just one of those places that has a line all the time and keeps doing specials that are ever impressive. 


Tompkins is also act above the rest here. There are many schools of thought about bagels and what the room places are. Tompkins always makes the list. Yes they do all the flavors and even have whacky cream cheese like birthday cake and cookie dough, but their power comes from the bagel. Hand rolled by a very special guy in the morning who works very hard and loves the job and making the bagels. You can get any breakfast Sammy from them and it will be incredible. A sesame with cream cheese is such a hit. 

If you had the bandwidth I’d go and support them and enjoy a bagel or two. It’s very much worth it. | Slice 
L’Industrie 9.5/10, Mama’s Too 8/10 (Cheesesteak is better than the pizza), Joe’s 7.5/10

Pie Only 
John’s of Bleecker St 9/10, Pizzeria Da Michele 8.5/10

If you want to venture a bit further you could hit a slice from Prince st pizza 7.5/10 or Scarrs 8.5/10 who both sell slices but aren’t in West Village | Coming from someone who tried to do 2 dinners for 3 days when we visited Austin I understand the want to try everything. I can also eat alot and have to admit embarrassingly that we did not succeed on all 3 days. My tip would be to remain focused and try not to let the menu let your eyes order. We believe in you and look forward to the replay. 

Day 1
- unsure if you're a Seinfeld fan but I do love the lobster roll and bisque at the original soup kitchen on 55th. It is also next to an authentic soba noodle place Azuma and below the yakitori restaurant Yakitori Totto.

Day 2
- Never been to Roosevelt but is on the to do list. I wonder if this is something you can do at night as I read it is magical then. That way you can head to Russ and Daughters early for breakfast then head downtown. There is an option to go to the Hudsons Yard location and then you could ride a citi bike downtown or to Chinatown and try the food there. You will go past Chelsea markets which also has a Los tacos if you wanted. I'd also try to go to Dominique if you can for the cronuts as you head downtown. 
- Someone's already mentioned it but Joe's is downtown. Personally I'd skip it but if you want to try it then go for it. 
- if you're after another burger the cheeseburger at T. Brasserie on puff pastry is rich and delish. Walk around Tin building and seaport and enjoy the vibes here. 
- By this stage you'll probably be a bit stuffed but if you have any more space go to fish market right near Tin Building for some amazing malaysian. It's a dive bar with the smashed glass door that was damaged during hurricane sandy. 
- now head to Staten Island and do the ferry. Then come back and ferry to dumbo. I would just walk around here. I don't recommend the time out markets here but the rooftop might be nice for views. Then walk back across the bridge and you can hang out in Chinatown if you want again before heading back uptown. For xiao long bao (soup dumplings) go to Noodle Village. For Hong Kong french toast go to Kong sihk Tong which is right across mei lai wah. Possible lines at the last 2 places. For banh mi go to banh mi co ut. Cash only for all but Noodle Village
- If you're tired of Chinatown then walk up to the village. Faiccos is a great Italian sandwich spot. One of our favourite Japanese bars is Bar Moga (might need to book). Or you can put your name down for Via Carota. 

Day 3
- I would skip Balthazar for breakfast and go to win son instead. If your day 3 is a weekday then the lines will be shorter. Balthazar isn't known for its breakfast and you won't be able to fit that much at win son if you eat beforehand. If you really want to to Balthazar then go at night for a drink as someone else suggested. Could do it at end of Day 2
- Peter Luger doesn't get a lot of love from most New Yorkers for a number of reasons but if it's on your to do list as it is for alot of other tourists I say go do it. The burger is great and make sure you also order the creamed spinach and bacon. If you can only fit one side then you must do the bacon
- for pizza you've already got the list but if you're full or short on time you could focus on just l'industrie and Fini and then walk the Williamsburg bridge to LES. Here, Scarrs is a short walk from the bridge and you can check out dimes square for the vibes. This way you can compare all your pizzas in one day. There's a tonne of food in LES too but you've got dinner and your show so maybe just stop at Supermoon for a cruffin if anything is left. 

I see you've already booked a Japanese restaurant for dinner. I don't know this one so can't comment but there is a restaurant I've been wanting to go to for a while in Astoria. It's called Koyo and they have a lunch special Omakase but I don't think you'll have time for this. 

There are also a number of Japanese ramen outposts including ichiran and tonchin. Ichiran does get super busy though unless you go at wierd times.

On 53rd there is also the urban Hawker which houses Singaporean outposts. My favourite there is the hainanese chicken at Hainan Jones and hokkien noodles at Prawnaholic. 

For Katz go at a wierd time like 3pm and you should be good for lines. I personally prefer 2nd Avenue but given its your first time go for the experience. 

Let me know if you have any questions. | Pretty sure all of the famous pizza places have long lines too. Just a call out because you have a lot of stuff planned in your schedule. | lol that’s why Katz was the last stop of the day. We also might split a half sandwich, so 1/4 technically a full sandwich each | No, that’s what I posted the list for, if it’s not as cool as I thought I’m very willing to listen to someone who knows more than me. I guess with walking to the ferry, taking it, walking to the tram and taking it it might eat alot of time, you’re right. I just thought my gf might get a kick out of it. Appreciate your thoughts either way! | Getting a lot of people telling me to skip it lol. I’ll leave it up to the GF | Airbnb, gf planned all that and the flight, all the other stuff is up to me. But noted, I’ll consider skipping the Roosevelt tram unless we have a bunch of time. Thanks! | Is the win son pop up the full menu? Can’t see it anywhere online. Saw their hours and the location that’s about it | Thank you so much for the notes. I’ll take as much as I can into effect.
As yourself or anyone knows, you can’t see it all no matter how many days you spend. There will be follow up trips! What I can’t do this time I’ll be referencing for the next.
I really appreciate your input and hope you’re able to see my trip recap I’ll be posting in about 2 weeks time. I won’t hold back on the wins and losses, lol | RIP your poops. | If you do the tram, there’s also a hotel a block away on Roosevelt Island with an art deco rooftop bar called the Panorama Room that has good views (drink is kinda spendy) | Noguchi Museum in Astoria is good | So in case you didn't know, AirBnB is illegal in NY unless the host is staying in the apartment with you. Just be aware, often these get canceled last minute | Shorter menu and only open Wednesday to Sunday 9am to 2pm so unsure if it works for you. | Thank you! Astoria seafood is also a potential hit, seems so unique. Definitely don’t want to ignore Astoria seems like a cool place from my limited research. Just hard to avoid manhattan as a first timer | Yes we were conscious of that & will be staying with a host. Won’t be any late nights or anything so hopefully not a problem. I think that’s great nyc made that rule. I can’t see a problem with supporting a local by giving them some $$ to stay with them through Airbnb, but if you feel otherwise I’d consider staying in hotels going forward | 100% Astoria seafood! | Astoria Seafood is good, but it's overwhelming for a first timer.

Non-Spanish Tapas-style Restaurants,"I love being able to order a few small plates to share with the table. I wen't to Shukette the other week which felt like a *Middle Eastern Tapas* and it was a great experience. 

Wondering if anyone has recommendations of similar, family-style restaurants around Manhattan that they would recommend. I'm open to all cuisines, somewhere I can bring my parents, and ideally less than $50/person.

-	Korean BBQ (share the meats, banchan, and other sides): Mapo | [Thursday Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1PXZhjWyiCVMSPpy5) does Korean-fusion tapas.

I don't remember anything much about the other dishes there but I was kind of disappointed by their Korean Popcorn Chicken dish. I was expecting it to be more like Taiwanese popcorn chicken but it ended up being more like a small plate of expensive general tso/Sweet and sour chicken for $15 lol.

I feel like [Phoenix Palace](https://maps.app.goo.gl/55jnE18hkGzsb5kTA) might also fit the bill but I haven't been there yet. Maybe it's more on the borderline of family style dishes instead of tapas though. | Mokyo is awesome. Korean-ish tapas. Kind of expensive though | Not in Manhattan, but Four Horsemen in Brooklyn is 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 | Great question! I love snacking and trying as many different things as I can. Loved Shuka (sister restaurant to Shukette) and its tasting menu. It used to be $45/person, which was such a steal! | I mean, haven't small plates been quite in vogue for a while now?

Dim sum!!!

I think that mezze are common at most, or at least many, non-casual Middle Eastern spots?

I feel like wine bars that are known for their food also tend to be small plates spots.

A lot of Japanese places, especially any izakayas.

ETA This isn't exactly the same, but maybe any Korean places that do a lot of banchan. I've never seen more than 4 in the city, but I feel like there must be somewhere that does more. You could still share your main dishes, but you will also get so many more things to nibble on. | Gurume fits the bill if you’re in Midtown - very good pairing before a show. Lovely service too. | Izakaya | Frena is similar to shukette but better imo. albeit more expensive too

I think you’re looking for somewhere that does small plates though. look up some wine bars they usually serve that style. Medi in hell’s kitchen comes to mind, as well as Ten Bell’s on broome st | Thursday Kitchen in the east village - korean | We love casa mono! | Do you like Peruvian? Mission ceviche is very good!

I feel like a lot of places do “small plates” these days! But especially a lot of Asian or Mediterranean places. | Ruffian in East Village.  It’s Eastern European and even has Georgian khachapuri

Also, Estela, Place des Fetes, and Claud are tapas/small plates (though pricey) | Gurumé and C as in Charlie both do Korean tapas | Buvette (west village) serves French tapas - lots of little plates to share. Great food. | Leyenda in Boerum hill - Latin - tacos to ceviche to empanadas and more | Buvette, Miss Ada | Maybe boat/conveyer belt sushi would scratch that itch too?  There’s gotta be a few of those around the city | Uluh | I feel like there's lots of wine bars that fit the bill. Ruffian, Claud, Place de Fetes... | Wonderland Bar in the east village. Asian fusion tapas and really fun drinks. | Avant garden is good if you like vegan  | Zaytinya is my go-to for family style mezze.  Excellent food.  Would skip the lamb shoulder special, which is the only dish there that has ever truly disappointed me, but otherwise excellent all around. | Ilili in Flatiron is an incredible Lebanese restaurant and they do the same style of service. Waitstaff is as friendly and personable as the food is delicious. Beautiful interior too | 
Tapas are inherently Spanish. Tapa: the spanish word for cover (now used to describe an appetizer). 

Appetizers are essentially what you're looking for. | Leland is so good. Their trout rillettes lives rent free in my head | Izakaya Mew looks awesome! I'm adding a few of these to my list, thank you! | C as in Charlie is delicious, we’ve eaten everything on the menu and keep going back. Absolutely amazing service too. | Thursday Kitchen was always my go to when I lived in the East Village. Their steak dish is so good | Why would you expect Korean popcorn chicken to be like Taiwanese popcorn chicken? | This looks really good, thank you for the rec | [Tofu Tofu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/do5zQoADXXvSBKNA7) in Chinatown gives you like 5 banchan. I don't have banchan that often but I swear I like theirs more than normal lol.

Their Korean Fried Chicken is low key one of the best in the city and the banchan is like a perfect pairing for it because most KFC takes like 20 minutes to make fresh and you can munch on the banchan while you wait.

Their fried chicken is more battered than typical Korean Fried Chicken but not as much batter as American Fried Chicken. They also drizzle a small amount of sauce instead of drenching the whole chicken in sauce. The non KFC dishes are good, solid, and homey but not spectacular.

[Kisa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bYq51eXPGePhhjwQ9) in LES might also be a good pick for banchan. I haven't tried it yet but I walked by the other day and their all Korean with 0 English awning caught my eye and I had to google them lol. You get to pick the main course (Bulgogi, Spicy Pork, Stir fried squid, Bibimbap) and every main course comes with the same 8 ban chan/side dishes. | I’ve walked by this place a few times a have been meaning to check it out! | This sounds good! I spent some time in Ecuador when I was younger so I imagine I could get down to Peruvian! | Yummy, thanks:) | Definitely recommend Izakaya Mew! Its one of my favorites. Great quality for the price and lots of great stuff on the menu. | I honestly wasn't aware that Korean had their own type of popcorn chicken until now lol. Thursday Kitchen is Korean fusion so I just assumed that it was some sort of Korean + Taiwanese Popcorn chicken fusion. | I went to Kisa recently, but I guess I didn't think it fit the bill because every person gets their own set of banchan. You still get all the little tastes, but they're not shared like with small plates or tapas. Kisa does 7 banchan though (I guess I stand corrected) plus soup. Refills are not unlimited, just for 3 dishes. | kisa is delicious. you can get refills on 3 of the banchans too. highly recommend."
giardino54 or Norma for good Italian?,,
Restaurants that have tasting menus with both omnivore and vegetarian options.,My best friend is coming into town next week and I would love to take her to a nice dinner. She eats just about anything but I am a vegetarian. Would love a good tasting menu that offers both options. Bonus points for restaurants that do great non- alcoholic drinks as well. ,"HAGS has both an omnivore and a vegan tasting menu! | The Musket Room is your best bet.

Other options to consider - Jean Georges, Per Se, Le Bernadin (although very heavy focus on seafood so depends on if you like that or tend to stay away from it).

Stay away from EMP, Dirt Candy and places that don't serve meat or your BFF will likely be disappointed.

Honestly, being that you are vegetarian and not vegan you don't have that many restrictions and many restaurants would accommodate both of you.

You could also look into some Italian places for pasta tastings. | How much do you want to spend? Where do you want to be?

Le Bernardin, Per Se, Daniel, Family Meal, and The Musket Room all have both veg/vegan tastings along w/ the omnivore option.

But honestly, I'd probably just suggest Dirt Candy.  Unless they're one of those ""I must eat red meat at every meal or I will die"" idiots they'll probably enjoy it. | This is a good list. I second Jean Georges. OP-check out all these menus and see which ones appeal to you. I’m a fan of 3 of the 4 (all but Per Se which I did not care for—mediocre food, very rushed service—that said it was a while ago but I have no desire to go back). | These are great options thank you !"

I've liked every sweet thing I've bought from Ciao, Gloria, and have even ordered full cakes from there for birthdays and they've always been a hit. I don't have sophisticated taste, though, so maybe some of their things are too sweet for people with more nuanced palates."
Christmas Dinner,Hi all. My family is coming to NYC for Christmas. Any recs on Italian or Chinese/Thai? Or anyone know any good restaurants open on Christmas?

Rowdy Rooster was a 4/10,In terms of spicy. Overall 7.8/10. Im now reading they changed the recipe but i asked to make it the hottest and it was barely hotter than Siracha. Where can I get the real spicy spice. I'm southeast Asian so I've tried most of the Mala/ Hunan Szechaun places already. ,"Try Ugly baby in BK | Apparently they took away the spiciest option. I have a pretty high tolerance and I was hyperventilating when I ate it a couple years ago | That's a shame, I had it when they first opened and level 5 was actually painful | I’m south Asian and it was extremely spicy (went with folks that grew up in south Asian and everyone had a similar reaction). The Szechuan food I eat in nyc would be less than mid level at rowdy (in a good way, RR goes extreme). Maybe rowdy has changed since the last time I went a year ago | Source on them changing the recipe? I know they took 4 and 5 off the physical menu, but they're still available on request. 3 was a solid as ever for me last month. I wouldn't call it a 10/10 in general, but for it's price tag, it's up there | Try the Isan places in Elmhurst (like Hug Esan or Zaab Zaab) | Go to Silky Kitchen and get the top level spice. I barely dare to go above medium | “Unapologetic Foods” pretty much apologized for being too spicy, and what they serve now is the result. Still delicious though. | Nanchang Flavor in Flushing is real spice if you ask for it. Super underrated regional cuisine in China, super spicy | When I went the spice was 7 but it was a 4/10 overall. 

Had a very different experience and was so ready to agree with this post. | Cafe China can bring it.  Also Land of Plenty. | They unfortunately got rid of their spiciest levels and the highest one now is mid heat even by my standards and I can take a good amount of heat. They originally were offering the higher heat here with only the Midtown location not having the spiciest but for some reason or another, they also got rid of the spiciest level at the OG location (perhaps it wasn't selling well but I doubt it.) I know others who enjoyed the level 4 and 5 there and the 4 was a good amount of heat for me with the 3 being probably a 5 on the scale and an 8 for the 4.

As noted by others, go to the Isan style Thai spots for very spicy food (would heavily recommend Hug Esan as it's my personal favorite but SaRanRom can make some quite spicy dishes along with the excellent Zabb PuTawn in Manhattan which recently opened a location in Cobble Hill in Brooklyn.  I would not recommend Zabb Zabb and I have no clue why they are super popular as it's honestly subpar under-spiced and salty Isan style Thai. Also in Brooklyn is the spicy and tasty Ugly Baby and it's worth dealing with their weird reservations. 

Alternatively to Thai, Chongqing or Hunan spots are a good idea for spicy food. For Indian, there aren't really super spicy spots outside of maybe the old Phaal at Brick Lane also in the East Village. There's well flavored and pretty spicy food but nothing that'll be difficult to handle. | Not exactly south Asian, but namkeen in Williamsburg is similar to rowdy rooster and in my opinion way better | There's a Korean place called Lim's Kitchen that I *suspect* has some really spicy options. I can't handle super spicy so I've only had their 'level 2' spicy fried chicken and it was way hotter than anything I've had in NY in a long time. And they have an option that's labeled 'level 5' spicy. Also the chicken is great! | Are you looking for any food that’s spicy? Which places have been spicy enough for you so far?

Advice for food crawl in Queens,"I'm trying to plan a 6-7 hour food crawl through Queens. Target neighborhoods are Jackson Heights, Corona, Forest Hills, Elmhurst, Rego Park (and maybe Flushing but trying to avoid Chinese food as we've done a whole Flushing Chinese food tour in the past). 

Looking for recommendations in any of those areas, aiming for counter-serve / casual / takeout spots where we can share a few things at each place. Any cuisine, looking for variety / stuff we wouldn't normally eat in our day to day, no dietary restrictions either (but aiming for slight Latin American & Middle Eastern emphasis). Feel free to stretch the region, I'll figure out routing / location filtering after gathering recs

The current shortlist:
- Ayada (perhaps too sit-down if anyone knows a more crawl-compatible Thai spot)
- Mariscos el Submarino
- Fuchka & Momos from carts in JH
- Kimganae
- Empanada Cafe
- Pahal Zan - falafel pita
- Andre's Hungarian Bakery - apple strudel
- Stix - kabobs
- Trinciti Roti Shop (a little bit far, if there are more places around then we'll go)

Appreciate y'all!","For Thai, I’d suggest Khao Nom or Khao Kang over Ayada. For Middle Eastern, you should head to Steinway Street in Astoria. Al Shams sweets and pastries is good.

Marani in Rego Park for Georgian cuisine. You can take a khachapuri to go (Stix and Marani are Kosher so will be closed Friday night - Saturday night). | Ayada is underwhelming. Go to Saranrom, Hug Esan, Khao Nom, or Khao Nom instead. | Trinciti is great but more than a little far. | You definitely need to stop at [Taco Veloz](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taco-veloz-jackson-heights) | >	Any cuisine, looking for variety / stuff we wouldn’t normally eat in our day to day

[Saturday Afternoon Jackson Heights or Flushing Food Tour?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1fez6a6/saturday_afternoon_jackson_heights_or_flushing/) | If you want to make a single stop and that's the end of your food crawl, I recommend Torta Pumas at the Tortas Neza food truck in Corona. The size of the torta is incredible, and it's really delicious, too. | As said, Khao Nom/Khao Kang for Thai.

Khao Kang is a steam table place, so you can just get a box of rice and whatever you want w/ it to share in a park or something.

Khao Nom for desserts (most of it's prepacked so you can grab and go).

Momo Crave does momos up like other dishes and is really fun to share.  Sukuti or Sandeko if you like spicy, Chili is addictive, Chat and Tandori are cute (and still good, taco is cute and kinda meh).  Sukuti is my favorite.

You don't have Filipino listed, and I only know a couple places for desserts (a personal failing).  Red Ribbon is a chain that I thought was just OK, Purple Dough is twee as fuck and expensive, but I thought it was really great.  Silvanas would be a great thing to get, but I love halo halo.

Bolivian Llama Party for saltenas, though my real love from them is how amazing their meats are (but those sandwiches/bowls are big). | Can I join the food crawl? | Trinciti roti shop is worth it!!!
Go for the doubles, bake & shark, curry & roti | Queens Night Market? | Birria landia is a must | Seems Ayada is a has-been in this thread lol, good to know. Thanks for the tips! Will try to hit Marani | I agree about Ayada. I got take out once because I saw so many raves about them, and everything was just so wet and soupy. I got both noodles and curry, and the pad see ew was swimming in sauce, and the curry was super thin and watery. | Noted! Been to Saranrom before, it was excellent. Will try Khao Kang/ Khao Nom | Sorry that was unclear, but more meant ""not the usual suspects"" (still unclear oops). But thank you for the list! Bookmarking all | Is closed for the season | I used to lead food tours of Queens as a hobby when I still lived in the city. I know my stuff! You’ll love Marani. Although it is a bit pricier due it being kosher. If you ever get the opportunity to visit the Republic of Georgia - go! | Ayada has gone downhill the last couple of years. | I actually went before the pandemic!"
"Remember pre-Covid, when Dishes on East 45th St. was packed everyday at lunchtime?  Sad. Place is dead. ",,"The place is dead because they jacked up their prices. I got serious sticker shock the last time I went | All the bowl places are packed though (cava/naya/chipotle/dos toros/sweetgreen/etc) | I work in the area and a lot of people took today off bc of Halloween with kids. | Holy crap. Haven’t been there in years bc of how packed and chaotic it always was. That’s nuts | Their prices went waaaaaaaay up. 

I love those orange roasted sweet potatoes but not as $27 a pound. | I'm not going to be nostalgic for mediocre Midtown hot bars. | Sad, but ill still take WFH over basically a cafeteria. | They used to have trays and trays of sushi rolls on Fridays.  They couldn't keep them full fast enough. | Way to expensive for what it is | Prices are nuts now. Used to be a nice expensive treat but now it legit costs restaurant money. 

Anyone remember that period they randomly decided to serve half off sushi though? | It was great 15 years ago, was it still great as recently as ""pre-covid""? | I didn’t realize they were still open. Half of my office used to go there everyday but we moved across town. I do miss their bacon and french toast | Omg yes I walked by the other day and remembered vividly when it was the hot new spot. They had a great BLT. | Lots of people WFH today because of Halloween. I saw a lot more people in the office on Monday. | My favorite expensive lunch buffet when I worked in NYC was City Bakery in Chelsea. I still remember the food, 15 years later... the chilled white fish with mustard sauce, the kale salad with hazelnuts, the cabbage slaw, and their pretzel croissants with mini hot chocolate. Sadly it closed during cofid I believe. Tbt, that place was fire. | Sushi roll Fridays at Dishes was epic pre pandemic. | I used to work across the street from this location!! I thought dishes went out of business. I miss it so much!! Nostalgia at its finest  | That place was great wow | Which day was this? It is kind of the thing now end of the week. Most people work from home. | Nobody wants to pay $30 for lunch, unfortunately | I go to Dishes for one thing and one thing only: Bacon and egg sandwich. | Wfh gang >>>> | Over priced | Their soups and chili were pretty good. The one at 53rd was crowded still about a year ago or so. Haven’t been back since moving jobs. | Had lunch at The Hugh today and it was jammed. | Sigh….. | Inflation, taxes , no one wants to work in the office people still wear masks lol | It’s a beautiful day and Halloween. There’s less people at all the lunch spots | ""It's so crowded nobody goes there anymore."" | nothing special about this place | Quality food. 
Think they jacked it up to like 18-19 a pound. 
Can’t go anymore. | midtown, like all manhattan is shell of its self | I don't understand why anyone would be yearning for the golden age of Dishes... | Lots of other please to eat at. It’s just not that interesting. | Nasty place | Their prices were high before Covid. The new pricing is too much. | Their prices went from high to obscene clocking in at $30 a pound lol. Also, a lot of people were off today for Halloween and Diwali so that might play into it. | i agree with that | What came first the chicken or the egg | Probably a little bit of both. No one coming in, making them raise prices | all prices throughout the city are jacked. | I'd much rather spend ~$14 at those places than randomly end up with a $20+ plate at the hot bar these days, the prices at these places are ridiculous. | I think you just described what seems like every block in midtown now. | Same, the office is dead today. Which sucks because I wore a costume and only like 4 people saw it | It's also Diwali, and school is out tomorrow for it. | Pic was taken yesterday. | exactly what I thought. | What did yogi say?  Place is so crowded no one goes there anymore | I also dream about those potatoes. I haven't been able to find something similar elsewhere.

But yes, they are so spendy | This sounds like so many nightmares in one sentence. | I know but my point is how this place used to be jammed packed every day at lunch. Regardless of whether one ate at the cold/hot bar,salads, sandwiches, soups noodle bar or Friday Sushi.. | Dishes is nowhere near mediocre though | Right? Sorry, but a hot bar is the last thing I miss when I'm working remotely. | Never worked in an office as an adult but I guess grass is always greener because I thought being in a centralized district with coworkers would be better than sitting alone all day. | That's cause they were half off lol | The food is fine but the prices are insane | This pic was taken yesterday, Wednesday | I miss their hot chocolate month | Yesterday, Wednesday 10/30 | Need to find out what where that is | this was taken yesterday | Thank you, Yogi. | It’s $27/lb now 😭 | That seems like the opposite of what you should do. | I mean, a bowl at all of those places is just under or over $20 now. | I work at a bar and lunch was busy-ish but we are usually pretty full at this time on a Thursday and it’s a ghost town. | My first year in the workforce as an adult, about a week before Halloween the head of my firm mentioned in a meeting that we all shouldn’t forget to get our costumes ready for the office next week. He was joking. Everyone knew he was joking. Well everyone except me. 

I lived that scene in Modern Family where the guy shows up to work in full costume and is mortified when everyone else is in regular suits. | Reddit to the rescue? : ) | I went in specifically to see people’s costumes and saw maybe 5 total. 2 of them were at 9 am in port authority getting off the bus with me | Well then, :( | Add overpriced to it | The one on 53rd gets packed… | Yeah, agreed. People who are saying so have clearly never eaten there.The food has a special level of deliciousness. | Remember pre-combustion engine, when horse stables were packed? Sad | You know can do coworking with your friends or hang out at a coffee shop right? You don’t have to be alone | Middle of the week also depends. Most companies still let employees choose their WFH days. But most places won’t ever go back to pre-pandemic days. | It’s the food court on east 53rd and Lexington. | It was beautiful yesterday too | No it's not. I go to Naya all the time and its $11.99, tax makes it $13, same with Dos Toros bowls. | I retroactively appreciate your costume if it makes you feel any better. | LOL | So you commute to a friend to work? Why not… just be in Manhattan for a few hours lol? I genuinely don’t get it. I don’t think it would be good to be at an office every day, but I also think it’s an extreme shift to what we’re at now. Central districts are a core function of cities and civilization. | maybe some day. | Thx. I’m on 40th. Too far for lunch | Ok but I’ve been by other less beautiful days and it looks like this on those days too. Personally I think the reasons are prices and wfh has drawn away the Dishes crowd. | I definitely agree they are out of their minds with the prices."
Post-Marathon Dinner Celebration,"I want to take a group of 6 or 7 to dinner after the marathon on Sunday. I'd like to eat a whole pizza/pasta/etc. I tried to get a res at Rubirosa and found it impossible, same with Emmett's. Does anyone have any other similar spots they'd recommend? Do we think I should just be able to walk in at Rubirosa? ","Many other people (and groups) are probably thinking of doing the same thing, so you’re pretty much out of luck if you can’t find a reservation. I wouldn’t risk doing walk-in and have to wait forever. Either order takeout and host at your place or find a place with a rezzie available (use opentable or resy) - most of the best spots will likely be booked this close to the date | Get Korean BBQ. Plenty of options and most can seat large groups. Jongro is my go to. ATTI if you're in Brooklyn. | Emmy Squared! Personal size pizzas and location in East Village and Williamsburg | reservation at emmett’s or rubirosa 😂😂😂 that’s a good one man | Can always get l’industrie to go | What about rice carbo load in Chinatown? | Palma and Picolla Cucina? | Arturo's on Houston? | Tonys Dinapoli on 64th and 3rd. | Try spunto in WV , f&f pizza or Frankies 457 both in BK | Lil Frankie’s? | Agree - this is a solid and reasonable take. I am just so bummed because I was on Resy at midnight trying to grab things and just got totally bot-fucked. Suckssssss. | Funnily enough… ended up getting a res at Emmett’s. Magic does happen | To be fair, by Thursday everything good for the weekend is pretty much gone lmao :( hope you find some yummy food to celebrate! Congrats in advance! | Totally agree - I was slow on the recovery here. Thank you very much!"
Thanksgiving Recommendations,"Typically, I travel to see family back home and we eat a (more or less) traditional Thanksgiving meal. This year, family is coming to NYC and wants to try dinner at a restaurant instead of squeezing into our apartment. 

Any suggestions for restaurants that do a tasty Thanksgiving meal in NYC? Preferably in the city.","Hearth, Bubby’s, Maison Pickle and more options here: [Are the options below good for Thanksgiving?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gdegh2/are_the_options_below_good_for_thanksgiving/) | Bubby’s."
Best Korean Corn Dogs in Manhattan?,"I know, I know, I'm like 5 years too late for this trend, but will be staying kinda close to Koreatown, and anyone have any spots to steer me in so I can finally try one? (I have technically tried them, but they were from the frozen section of my local Asian grocery store.)","I like Two Hands the most even though they are a chain/franchise. 

I didn't like the setup from OK Dog and I feel like they're less newbie friendly. They have a sauce bar and make you put on your own sauce. It's great if you know what the fuck you are doing and know which sauce combo goes well with which corn dog. For me, I was putting on random ass sauces and making a mess at the sauce bar and the concoction I made did not go well with the corndog. Their egg toast sandwich is also meh, I thought it looked a lot better than how they taste. 

This is probably a skill issue bit I like how Two Hands drizzle the sauce on for me instead having to do it myself.

Jongro Rice Hotdog has a Ramen corn dog that sounds amazing on paper but it wasn't as good as what I was expecting. I liked the classic sweet potato dog more than the ramen. | I walk by one on my way to therapy- Jongro Rice Hotdog (next to Machi machi) on 32nd. It seems traditional to the Seoul street food. | Hmart upstairs has them. And I think they are super cheap on certain days. | Try Food Court 32 on W 32nd near 5th | I don't know how good they are, but OK Dog will have them. | Yeah, I am like a judge on a Food Network show, I want the sauces applied for me! | I didn’t even know HMart HAD an upstairs! | The ones there are not very good, imo. | They're probably OK. | Well this doesn’t quite answer their question, does it? | I think it would have been fine if they had a recommendation as to which sauce goes well with which corn dog. Or if they add the default amount of sauce for you and then you can go to the sauce bar to customize it or to add more if you want.

It ends up feeling like I'm at the sauce bar at a AYCE hot pot. Like they have 20 different sauces laid out and I'm putting random different sauces into my sauce concoction. It always turn out ""meh"" because I have no clue what the fuck I'm doing lol. | OP asked what places have Korean corndogs, and I answered with a place that serves Korean corndogs, a place that the top comment also mentions. What have you contributed?"
Looking for tom kha that's more than just sweet,"I've had tom kha from a few different places, and each time the broth has tasted like little more than sweet coconut.  Proper tom kha broth is supposed to have more flavors going on.  I have faith in NYC to supply me with this, but I'll be damned if I've found it yet.

Any leads?","I had some from Chao Thai recently that was really good and not sweet to me. Also Ayada was pretty good. The worst I’ve had has been at CorTHAIyou but you would have no reason to go there unless you live in the neighborhood. | I just make it myself, I haven't found it to be good anywhere | Terra Thai, 6th bt a/b | Zaab Zaab | it would help if you named the places you’ve been to already first. | Lan Larb Chiangmai | Honestly it's so easy to make tom kha if you can get your hands on lemongrass, if you like it with some kick I cannot recommend this recipe enough: [https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263772/spicy-coconut-chicken-mushroom-soup/](https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263772/spicy-coconut-chicken-mushroom-soup/) | I see they have locations in Brooklyn and Queens--can I ask which you've been to? What did you think of the tom kha? | I've been to Elmshurst, Flushing and Williamsburg locations. While I haven't specifically tried their tom kha, all of their dishes, including other soups I've had, are a departure from the sweet style of Thai commonly found in the city and lean into herbacious, acidic and spicy. Looks like the Williamsburg location has a tom kha. | They lean into a very deep and strong spice mix. | How’s the Tom yum? I’ve been on the lookout for a herby clear Tom yum that isn’t sweet."
"birthday dinner ideas, please help!","Hi! So I am going out with 7-12 friends for a 25th birthday dinner end of November in NYC and am in desperate need of some help. Some of us are going to be staying in the LES. 

I am looking for a great Asian or Italian food place to go. Ideally someplace where good food meets great atmosphere at a reasonable price (around $50 a person). 

(I saw Puglia NYC but idk if that is worth it, thought of going up to Tao Downtown but unsure if the food is worth the distance)

  


Also any bars/speakeasies/jazz club recs for the LES would be GREATLY appreciated! I have been out a few times and I found a few but would love to know where everyone is  going. 

The vibes for the saturday evening is: dressing up, dancing, good music, great drinks, good photo op spots, and good convos. Open to bar/speakeasy/club hopping. Trying to stay in LES or around there. 

  
thank you!!","To be honest in that budget it will be very hard to find anything in the city. 
You can go to Mr. Purple, which would suit you location and wibe wise, they also have a rooftop and drinks, but nowadays they charge 25$ for casamigos with soda nowadays 😆

I think Berry Park and Westlight in Williamsburg are a bit cheaper, but again in this budget we talking about having burger and a beer. 
Both places have rooftops, live music and there are opportunities for pictures. 
You will have to cross a bridge though, which isn’t much of a hassle.

Also, if staying in LES is a priority then Gray Lady has great promos like buy one get one aperol spritz and espresso martinis on Thursdays. | Ms Yoo - amazing food and turns into a club later on. | Chinese Tuxedo. Might be a little more than $50, but otherwise ticks all of your other boxes. | Chinese Tuxedo is amazing but for 50$/pp they can have a drink and an app to share there."

","Malatesta Trattoria might be good, if you try calling ahead today you could see if they have an early spot open! No online reservations I think 

La Lanterna di Vittorio is in the village near NYU and the back patio is enclosed and cute! The resy looks booked but I’ve never waited there more than 15 min even during prime time, I think a ton of their seats are for walk ins - maybe worth calling to ask if they can add a res for you tho!

Further east I love il posto accanto, they don’t do online reservations either but call the number on the site and Julio can book you a res. | Supper is an easy res | Malaparte is good too | Our local place is Arte on 8th St west of University Place. Invited my family, all native New Yorkers, and described it as ""old-school Italian,"" which of course is totally their jam. They loved it.

Edit: Brain fart. Arte is actually on 9th St (but still west of University Place!). | Bird dog is great! Killer pastas. Italian meets southern. | Il buco or Anton’s ! | Alice

So cozy and lovely; great food and service. | da Toscano!!! | Bar pitti is walk-in only/cash only and great Italian food | Gigino Trattoria in Tribeca. Cute, great food. Another recommendation is La Mela on Mulberry St. You can probably get a reservation fairly easily at either restaurant. Neither one is in the West Village, but they are close by and their food is yummy. | I enjoyed Scalini Fedeli, not on the current buzz list ~~and maybe a little pricey~~ (Edit2: Its fixed price), but have been a few times and enjoyed. (Edit, in Tribeca technically) | Fiat Cafe is pretty decent, but very small. For really good food, I would try Ciccio or nearby to Fiat cafe is Epistrophy. | Il cantinori maybe | Osteria Carlina is an easy rec and very underrated. I have been twice and like the food there, esp the pasta and osso buco | Bar primi is very good if you don’t mind sitting outside! | Aria wine bar, suprema | I’ve never had an issue walking into trattoria pesce pasta. It’s not as trendy as most places but it is cute and the food is solid and well priced. | piccola cucina isn't far if Soho works | [deleted] | I've always wanted to try Pepolino on Lispenard and West Broadway. Not the Village and not a recommendation because I've never been there. But it is cute. | La Lanterna was recommended to me here by someone too and took my parents. Great meal. The lasagna floats / tasting was brilliant.

They all only accept cash. Enjoy | Supper easy! | My parents loved Arte when we lived over there. Under the radar old school and very cute Italian restaurant. Solid food | I only went once but Vic's has been the most awful sit-down meal I've had in New York.

Chinatown Restaurant with lazy Susan,"Hey guys planning a dinner celebration for like 10-12 people and we really want to go to Chinatown. I love the idea of the spinning table lazy Susan and ordering a bunch of stuff for the table, does anyone have good recs for restaurants with this?
","Almost any Chinese restaurant with a round table that can seat 10 will have a lazy Susan for that table. Otherwise it's pretty hard to eat family style at such a big table without it.

Most Chinese restaurant that does dinner also have set menus where they will offer something like 8 courses for the table. Unfortunately most of the time, this menu is only avilable in Chinese lol.

If you're looking for the set menus, Wu's Wonton King is the play (assuming that you can't read Chinese lol) because [they have some of the set menu in English](https://yelp.to/q5WXGJYBwO) and it's one of the few English menus that I've ever seen.

Bathrooms are in basement, stairs only.

Wu's will probably be fine if you don't have someone with special needs in your group. They will probably even be nicer to you if everyone in your group is able-bodied.

I'm not sure if everything we endured while dining there was to their clear annoyance of the person in our group who uses a wheelchair. (getting body-checked by the server as she put food on the table, telling us we had one chance to order food, that we wouldn't be able to add on to our order later. Rushing our group to order and leave).

"Mr Moto, Atomix, Le Bernardin reviews","Late October 2024

Office of Mr Moto 9/10

Despite the hype and hard-ticket status, I haven't seen a lot of reviews for Mr Moto on reddit, so here's one. I decided to go to Mr Moto because I couldn't get into Sushi Sho or Yoshino (both of these places had reservations for 2 available, but not for 1, even though they supposedly will reserve for 1...seems fishy, literally), so I decided this might be a good opportunity to go ""downmarket.""

I was initially hesitant to book Mr Moto. I was worried that it was going to be all flash and no fish... All gimmick and no haddock (a gimmick that combines the unrelated themes of ""19th century naval expeditions"" and ""speakeasy"") without the sushi chops to back it up. Plus, the one review that I did find on reddit was not positive. But I figured, it's sushi, how bad can it be? 

I should mention my experience with sushi: I've been to a million Midwestern alacarte sushi places, but the only omakase that I'd ever been to before Mr Moto was Noz17 in NYC (2022). Noz17 was one of the great food experiences of my life, so I was expecting Mr Moto to be a bit of a let down. 

Well--keeping in mind that I'm an omakase newbie from a flyover state--I was not disappointed at all. Mr Moto was an absolute delight. 

The theme here is edomae style... Most of the 20 or so total courses were nigiri, either fresh or marinated. But there were about 4 appetizers, including some abelone, tempura bites, and marinated black cod... These were all excellent and perfectly prepared. 

Next, the sushi courses began. 15 pieces. The first few were cured/marinated and these were all terrific, including shad and sea bream. The marinades used on these were to my liking... Not sweet or otherwise overpowering. Fresh sushi came next, with a couple of things that I had never had before at a sushi place, including barracuda (which was awesome). As expected, each piece of fresh fish was brushed with some kind of sauce (mostly based on either dark or white soy sauce) and finished with a garnish. The flavors on all of these sauces and garnishes were perfect , and the fish was all very tender.

VS Noz17: So, Noz17 is about $400, Mr Moto about $200. Both places had excellent food, and were worthwhile experiences. I feel that it's worth comparing these 2 since both of them overwhelm you with 20+ courses, which is what I like. The main difference is that Noz17 felt a great deal more more ""fine""... Each piece of nigiri or sashimi (Moto had no sashimi, only nigiri and a single hand roll at the end) at Noz17 looked very clean and the quality of the ingredients and complexity of some of the the non-nigiri/sashimi preparations were more complex. At Mr Moto, the pieces looked a little ragged and the rice was spread/packed in what seemed to be an indifferent manner. The garnishes at Mr Moto looked a little sloppy, and in general, although I was there for around 2 hours, the chefs seemed a little rushed at Mr Moto, whereas the main chef at Noz17 (Junichi Matsuzaki, I believe) seemed more cool and in full control of his environment (Noz 17 also seats about half of what Mr Moto seats). The main chef at Mr Moto (I do not remember his name... He is a 50 year sushi veteran) does not really speak English, and this put a bit of a barrier batween patron and chef. At Noz17, the chef introduced each dish himself, and answered questions. At Mr Moto, the manager introduced each piece, and was available to translate questions (this is a bit awkward... No one really asked any questions lol). There was also the ambience... Noz17 exuded elegance, calm, and confidence. The place was absolutely sterile, perfectly lit, and immaculately laid-out. Mr Moto is a little dark, with an auxiliary seating area behind the sushi counter (that is, to your back if you're sitting at the counter) which is a bit distracting. There was a some grime and sloppiness around the chef's working area at Moto (not ancient grime, just stuff that accumulated during the session... All this stuff was more carefully manicured at Noz17). The mood was also very different. While there was some conversation at laughter at Noz17, the mood was lively and even a bit raucous at Mr Moto... The Yankees and Dodgers were playing, and everyone (including the chef, who is a Yankees fan, and the apprentice, a Dodgers fan [but except me, who has literally never watched a single complete baseball game]) was arguing baseball and some people were watching the games on thier phones. In other words: Noz17 felt like true fine-dining omakase, while Mr Moto was--despite all the gimmicks--more like a neighborhood sushi counter with very good omakase option. I think that both places offered an experience that was appropriate for their respective price-point. 

Some other notes:
Rice: I'm not a sushi rice expert, but the rice here was good. Many Midwestern sushi places serve undercooked rice (or even the wrong kind of rice) with sushi. The rice here was sticky (but not too sticky) and had a good mouthfeel. I didn't notice a particularly strong flavor to the rice recipe... The rice complemented the fish. 
Temp: the fish was served at room temp for the most part, which is what you would expect (again, a lot of inland sushi places serve this stuff too cold) 
Blowtorch: I do not know much about the history of sushi, but I would assume that blowtorched sushi is more of a western thing? Several courses here were seared, which surprised me. When I saw the apprentice grab the blowtorch, I cringed a little... I usually dislike seared sushi. But, once again, I think the problem here is that I've only experienced Midwestern seared sushi, which in many cases is likely seared hours before you eat it. Freshly seared sushi is a totally different experience... The crispy bits are still smoking when you eat it. All of the seared pieces were excellent. (Noz17 had no seared courses iirc.) 
Sake: I got the entry level sake pairing, which was very good. There were a couple of commonly available sakes here that I'd had before, including Drunken Whale. There were 5 glasses of sake... I wouldn't have minded 1 or 2 more (or some beer) but I wasn't clear on whether one could order extra drinks here. 
Apprentice chef: I saw that some reviews have complained about the apprentice chefs at Mr Moto. Some have said that the apprentice's pieces were sloppy compared to the main chef's. I was served by the main chef, so I can't really comment on the apprentice's skills, but looking down the row I thought that all of the pieces had a similarly baggy appearance lol. I liked the apprentice, though. He spoke English and was funny, and was clearly committed to the job. He was young guy who grew up in California, but has been working in sushi for a few years. I don't know if he's the only apprentice or not, but his manner suggested that he was there quite often. 
Smell: I think it's important to mention that the whole place at Mr Moto smelled like a fish market. I have never noticed this in a sushi place before, at any price level. I did not mind this smell (it's seafood!) but some of the other patrons commented. I suspect that this was from the room-temp sushi, which was sitting close-at-hand to the chefs the whole night, but Noz17 also used plenty of room temp fish and I did not notice an odor there. I could see how this might put people off, but I had no problem with it. 
Eel course: this was the only piece that was not excellent. It was very much like the BBQ unagi that you get at any USA sushi place, except with a lot less sauce. But it was still sweet. I do not care for sweet sauces on fish in almost any case. 

Overall: I could see why some people might not like Mr Moto. In some ways it's neither ""fish"" nor fowl... It didn't have some of the things that might be appealing to a neophyte omakase-enjoyer (no steak courses, no salmon nigiri, no fancy maki with sweet-spicy mayo drizzles) but it's also not the tightly orchestrated, elegant, and authentic omakase trip that sushi veterans might be looking for. But for me--someone who's somewhere in the middle of thier sushi journey--Mr Moto's ship was the perfect vessel. Maybe not the trip of a lifetime (like Noz17), but it certainly took me where I wanted to go on that particular evening. 

Would I go back? Hmmm. Probably not, but only because I rarely get to NYC, and there are *a lot* more restaurants and omakases on my list! But if someone else wanted to go or if it was convenient, I wouldn't hesitate to hop on board. 

Atomix 8/10
Atomix gets a 9/10 for service, atmosphere, and presentation, but 7/10 for food. 

The meticulous attention to detail at Atomix began before the meal, and even before the seating, with a tasting of some of the fermented soy sauces that were to be used in the meal, along with some explanations and history of the soy-fermentation process. Very cool! Once seated, we were invited to pick our own chopsticks and to decide upon the truffle upgrade option and additional drinks. There was a bit of a hiccup here that was my fault... I initially declined a cocktail but, after seeing everyone else's cocktails, I asked if I could see the drink menu again. This caused some consternation and furrowed brows among a couple of servers. I had accidentally brought humiliation upon these people! I was eventually given the drink menu but it was taken away before I was ever able to order anything. I think that the timing is so structured in the place that my request was simply too much to possibly accommodate! 

Food followed, and each course (about 7, plus some amuses-bouches) was plated with flawless precision and looked gorgeous. Each item was also accompanied with a card, showing the ingredients and a bit of info about the dish, including history. Very cool. Service continued to be flawless. 

The food, though, ranged a bit in quality for my palate. In general, the dominating flavors were umami and sweetness which I, frankly, do not think go well together, especially when the combo is not balanced out with salt, acid, etc. 

The first amuse-bouche was very good, an umami-bomb of (iirc) mushroom, seaweed, and some kind of cracker. It was arranged a bit like maki. The second amuse-bouche was probably my 2nd favorite thing of the evening. It was the kind of thing you find in a lot of amuse-bouche courses: a crisp wafer with some caviar, fish, and crème fraîche. Very straightforward but, notably, not sweet at all and also not imploding with umami. The next 2 courses were fish based. One was some sashimi with dressing. This was good, with excellent crunch from some diced vegetables, but a bit sweet for me and ended up being kind of flavorless. The next course was excellent... Fish and mushroom in a green dressing. Lots of umami but not too much--or too much sweetness--to overwhelm the fish. The next course was sliced Korean cucumber in dressing. This was both flavorless and a little hard to eat... You had to kind of jam your spoon down through it to get a bite. Very pretty though! 

The next course is the one that unfortunately defined the meal. This started with another 10/10 presentation, as the servers showed us raw crabs that had been marinating in soy sauce. This is a Korean staple, apparently, and was to be featured in the next dish. How interesting! I've never tasted raw, marinated crab. 

This was the most beautiful and elaborate dish of the evening. It was structured like a large macaron, with alternating crispy layers and tender layers, and covered with an orange/pink, gellied topping that was swimming with scallion slices. The thing glowed! It looked like a dish from another planet. Our perhaps something that would be served on the way to another planet. 

The dish was undone, though, by one of the layers. I think it was some kind of ginger/sesame dressing? There was far too much of it, and it tasted a little like fois gras. And the gellied topping was sweet. Somewhere in the slop of that icing and dressing I saw some crab pieces. But, alas, I still do not know what soy-marinated crab tastes like, because all I could taste was that other stuff. 

More dishes followed, including a tempura fish course (great texture, too sweet), another fish course (very nice, including a side of cuttlefish/beet kimchi that was the highlight of the whole meal--acidic, crunchy, beautiful--but the size of an international postage stamp), and a very tasty but straightforward waygu dish. Oh, and that truffle add-on? I probably shouldn't have ordered that. I like truffle, but it only amplified the umami of the one ""savory"" (too sweet) dish that it was applied to, and it just tasted dry and chalky on the otherwise excellent dessert. (BTW I hope it goes without saying that the freshness and quality of all the ingredients were 10/10)

I should mention the wine pairing. Most of the wines were very nice indeed, but one of them was a rice wine that was very strange... It had a rich, overpowering umami smell and a sugarsweet taste. Someone must like this wine somewhere, but it was not to my taste, especially when paired with the relatively subtle seafood flavors of this meal. Then there was the dessert wine. I despise most dessert wines anyway (I know) but this was the worst of the worst, in my opinion, with the consistency and flavor of literal molasses with a shot of alcohol added. I would have liked to order a black tea to go with dessert but, for some reason, I was not offered this, although the person sitting next to me was (and there wasn't time to ask for it, either... Another example of how everything at Atomix is, for better or worse, precisely timed). It looked like a very nice tea service. 

Overall, I think that someone who likes unorthodox flavor combinations (and, in particular, sweet flavors applied to ""savory"" courses) would enjoy Atomix a lot more than I did. Obviously, that must be the case, given the place's revered status. Assuming that the menu was different, I would certainly go back and give it another go, especially if I was with someone who really wanted to try it, but I suspect that my palate and the palate of the Atomix culinary team simply do not jibe. 

Le Bernardin 10/10

I've been to Le Bernardin one before, at lunch, about 15 years ago. I remember thinking that is was pretty good, but that I was not blown away. I decided to go again though, because, when looking up ""best seafood-focused nyc tasting menu"" here on reddit, Le Bernardin kept coming up. What also kept coming up, of course, were refrains like ""overrated,"" ""catnip for rich tourists,"" ""past its prime,"" etc, along with at least one person who called it literally ""sickening."" 

So let's say I went in not knowing quite what to expect! 

I ordered the tasting menu, plus 2 additional items from the ""regular"" menu: tuna fois gras and octopus. The waiter warned me that it would be a lot of food! I appreciated this, but I'm glad that I ordered the extra items. Not because the main tasting menu wasn't enough food, but because everything was so good that I wanted to try even more! 

I won't go through all the dishes, but one flavor dominated almost all the courses. And that flavor wasn't sweet or unami, acid or bitter. The flavor was seafood. Each dish was a piece of seafood, prefectly complemented with simple dressings and garnishes that added (mostly) salt and acid flavors without overwhelming the flavors of tuna, octopus, hamachi, salmon, or lobster. The last two dishes violated this a bit... The steamed halibut seemed like it was designed to taste like a turkey dinner, and the grilled hiramasi was, likewise, set-up as a substitute for a steak course. In these 2 dishes, the preparations drowned out the fish a little (but what are you gonna do? I mean it's halibut). But you know what? These courses still tasted good! Oh, and the wine pairing was flawless. I'm not always the biggest fan of white wines, but all of these were fantastic (and, notably, not very sweet... I think you may note a theme here). 
 
It was interesting to compare Le Bernardin and Atomix, back to back. Atomix is more modern and experimental in both service, mood, and food. Some of those experiments worked on me, and some did not. Le Bernardin's preparations were indeed old-fashioned, and so was the service, but everything hit the mark. I'm sure someone else would have a different opinion, but I know which experience I preferred.

(Crosspost-ish) Anyone know if Suki Curry is still open? (E 50th/third/Manhattan) ,"FYI I can’t seem to Crosspost from the asknyc sub& found this sub after so this is a copy and paste sorry!!


Hi I’ve been obsessed with this curry place since I visited NYC 5 years ago. 


I have sent friends over and they have loved it. However, in the last two years/ever since they merged locations with their sister store/same chef, I’ve been getting reports that the place is closed during lunch hour. And now their yelp says they’re closed. 😭


I’m finally visiting NYC in the next month and am doing some predetective work to see if it’s actually open or not. 


I’ve called, sent DM through instagram. No answers. I’ve even considered calling a neighboring spot to see what’s goin on. 😅


For anyone who knows / is in the area personally: 
- is Suki still open?
- what are their hours?
- if closed, is the close temporary? When will they reopen?
- is Hakurakuso (the sister store) open? What are their hours?
- how tf do I get a reservation at Hakurakuso? (Their OpenTable doesn’t work)


Their website:

Their sister store:

As you can see. I’m disgustingly obsessed. I know all the details from their instagram, yelp, webpages. But it’s just all so unclear. Thank you!!!","I went to Suki this summer and seems like they had just reopened so it’d be surprising if they’re closed again. You could try calling them? | This place is so weird. I went years ago when they were still at their St Marks place. I love it at the time, but then they moved their location without changing anything on their site or on maps. I finally went to their new location early this year and honestly, it wasn't anything to write home about. The katsu was dry, breading was minimal, the curry was barely enough for the rice they gave. Very disappointed overall, and not surprised they're closing again. | they're closed - my office is next to their last location. unknown if / when they'll reopen as no answer to phone calls or email and nothing on their website or socials. but google indicates they're ""closed temporarily"".

they relocated to a fancier midtown east space at some point in the last couple years and were always empty despite the food still being good, so hopefully just moving to a better location | Tried calling. No answer :( | They used to be a really special place, and got worse each time they moved. It’s a shame. | UGH you totally get what I’m so confused about / why I’m asking. 

That’s so disappointing— their St Marks spot was such a wonderful and cozy memory. I’ma be a little delusional and pray they at least kept the curry sauce recipe the same. Even the tiniest bite, I just want one bite of *that*.🤣 | THANKK YOU. The true answer I praying for. 
I really really really appreciate it. 

Sucks, but one can only hope they’ll be back.

A while back [I did a comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1eyp9cp/chicken_caesar_wrap_from_milano_market_uws_left/) of both Milanos' chicken caesar wraps.  Westside drenched mine in dressing.  They were a little lighter-handed this time, and I added bacon, which improved the wrap dramatically.  It does seem like I'll have to start saying ""light on the dressing"", though.  Definitely want to try the Milano Special next.

[Court Street Grocers](https://www.courtstreetgrocers.com/menu-laguardia)

I had some lackluster experiences with these guys shortly after the worst of the pandemic, but I'm glad I've given them more chances.  I will say their pork-based sandwiches are especially good.  This one is their ""Ultimate Warrior"", which has pork shoulder, broccoli rabe, provolone, pecorino, pickled red peppers, and mayo.  Fantastic sandwich and it would probably now be my first recommendation for anyone new.

[De Hot Pot](https://www.yelp.com/biz/de-hot-pot-brooklyn)

[Tried doubles for the first time last month at A&A](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1fpf9xu/recent_eats_buvette_aa_new_arping_joseph_leonard/) and they were amazing.  Went to this place after seeing it recommended by one of the DJs I follow on IG, and wasn't disappointed!  Same price, $2.50 apiece, and yes they do roti and other stuff too which I'm keen to try.  It's strictly to-go, but Prospect Park is right there.

[Percy's Pizza](https://www.percyspizza.com/)

Hadn't been to this Village fixture in quite a while.  They're cheaper than, say, Joe's or Bleecker Street, so you kinda know what you're getting, but I have to say this mushroom slice was better than what I've had from them before.  I've gotten slices with next to no cheese but they seem to have stepped up their game a bit.

[Roscioli](https://rosciolinyc.com/)

Never been to the actual restaurant but they had a pizza booth for a street festival.  I can't say I was terribly impressed.  Not the worst I've ever had, but definitely below-average for what you'd expect from a place that seems to desire a higher reputation.

Pastrami - enjoyed it though I can't help myself from comparing it to Katz

Leg of Lamb - okay, little flavorless

Milano Special - meh but I'm not a fan of cold cuts to begin with. I've only liked All'Antico Vinaio cold cut sandwiches because they've solved the (imo) fundamental problem of cold cuts - they're all dry as fuck. 

Cuban - really bad aftertaste. I have no idea what that aftertaste is but I couldn't finish more than a quarter of it.

The Dalton - sucks. Flavorless and dry. I thought they forgot the chipotle aioli but I opened it up and saw that they just use an incredibly small amount. It didn't even cover most of the sandwich... The chicken cutlet was tough. Like I struggled to pull a bite off and they had to have used the worst fake and plasticky mozzarella I've had in my life.

Mind sharing your thoughts on which of these place’s you thought were worth trying? | Check the bakeries in K-town! I had a friend bring a fluffy ube cheesecake that was exceptional and DIFFERENT. | Honestly Juniors cheesecake is the best in the world to me; the ‘dream’ New York cheesecake. I appreciate that cheesecakes can be clever and adventurous but juniors is just perfection. | It's not technically a cheesecake, but a cheese tart: [Pink Lady](https://www.pinkladycheesetart.com/cheese-tarts-flavors) in Two Bridges area has some really fun flavors to try out. The [Keki bouncy cheesecake](https://www.kekimoderncakes.com/menu) is another fun, unique spin since you've got the classics down. [Harbs](https://www.instagram.com/harbs1981/?hl=en) also has some fun spins on cheesecakes, but their online menu isn't up to date, so you'll have to stop by and see what they have. 

\-Julia | I initially read the title as ‘Cheesesteak’ then saw Oreo crust and thought “you sick fucks” | Not a cheesecake place but I really enjoyed the blueberry cheesecake from Petit Chou | Unfortunately Two Little Red Hens closed. I still dream about their Brooklyn Blackout cake | Striphouse Oreo cheesecake is amazing | kiki’s is the best the city | Jora’s passionfruit cheesecake | Kiki’s cheesecake is really good. | Literally obsessed with the Keki Japanese cheesecake.. I ate an entire ube one by myself lol | Posh pop peanut butter cheesecake!!  | S and S. I think you can still buy at their wholesale operation. They supply a lot of the steak houses etc. for me, it's the best pure rich NY cheesecake in the game. I've been eating them forever .... 

ps little red hens has been out of biz for 4 years. And keep saying they're reopening. That was one of the best home style American bakeries in NY. Best pies and classic cake in the city | Kuih Cafe for pandan and ube flavor! | Gage and Tollner make a Chèvre cheesecake that’s super good. | Our NY team just published our[ brand new guide to our favorite cheescakes in the city](https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/guides/best-cheesecake-nyc?utm_campaign=reddit&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=reddit).  The ones not on your list that might suit your tastes: S&S (supplies Peter Luger), Ernesto's (Basque perfection), Kuih Cafe (pandan Basque) and Keki Modern Cakes (original and ube). | Tried almost all of the above, but I had the best cheesecake at The Cut restaurant at the Four Seasons hotel downtown. They have a coffee shop adjacent where you can order it too | Ferrara has the best cheesecake in manhattan | I am also a plain Junior lover and I know you want Manhattan but Agi’s Counter blew me away. Make a trip out of it and you can go to the Brooklyn Museum or Botanical Gardens while you are at it. Their food is also phenomenal. | Eileen's Special Cheesecake on Cleveland street in downtown Manhattan. Mom and pop store that's been there for decades. Great variety, friendly service, and great tasting cheesecakes that are to die for! | Cheesecake is my favorite dessert unfortunately my favorite isn't in Manhattan. Martha's Country bakery is the best for me. Huge slice of thick, rich, creamy goodness (pause). | Best cheesecake is my cheesecake you'll lick your fork and plate clean based. | Yeah but the original not the chocolate. That’s just gilding the lily | Yeah basque cheesecake really fucks. So creamy and gooey. I do love a cheesecake with a crust as well. | This one is my fav! Also I usually hate cheesecake crust and these don't have one. | Basque as opposed to New York or Italian? Ive never heard of that variation, its actually better than both styles? | Also Mercado / Little Spain in Hudson Yards for basque cheesecake. More goat cheese flavor. 

Mia’s Brooklyn for traditional. | Yes. Basque cheesecake. I had one at La Sirene in SoHo that rocked my world. | I once inhaled an entire small one by myself. I had to lie down afterward but it was totally worth it | Love their ricotta cheesecake. I actually don’t love Veniero’s as a whole (a lot of items are just middling), but that ricotta cheesecake can’t be topped. | Venieros is killer. Great table seating as well | Peter Luger serves S&S, so OP already tried it. | >Veniero’s by East Village!

Love this place! | It's my favorite too, for nostalgia reaaons. | Same, you cake go wrong with Juniors. | Oooh, I was about to say that I also love Pink Lady Cheese Tart, but now I see that your account is a promotional account, and your post history is mostly promotion or promotion disguised as suggestions or Q&A. I sure don't love that for this sub! | Ugh I came to this thread and got excited for a second that maybe it reopened…but I guess not…I used to live on that block and got their cupcakes ALL the time. | I just looked this place up….their prices just gave me a stroke lmao | Thankfully NYC has a pretty solid transit system 😅 | Regular flavor over matcha as well? | Nothing to get slightly soggy or spongy! | It is a specific style — usually no crust, often but not always with some goats cheese, and always burnt on top — but not so much that it has a burned flavor. It’s a specialty of Basque — northern Spain and some southern France, but mostly Spain. If you live in NYC, go to little Grace bakery. If you love cheesecake you’ll be happy. | 100% worth it but oh man are they not typically eaten in one go?... I always go to town on those things lol I've had one and bites of my partner's chocolate version! | Hi! Not promoting anything here, just suggestions from our staff that we truly enjoy :) 

\-Julia | Try Ladybird Bakery in Brooklyn for a great Brooklyn Blackout Cake that’s very similar. The owner of Ladybird and the owner of Two Little Red Hens used to be co-owners of Two Little Red Hens, with a location in the UES and one in Park Slope on 8th Avenue. I think they split up the partnership in the late aughts, with each one keeping one location. The owner of the Park Slope location renamed her bakery to Ladybird. They were at 8th Avenue until recently, when they moved to Windsor Terrace at 252 Prospect Park West, near the F train 15th Street subway station. | Oh I haven’t had the matcha one but I thought the chocolate was just too much. And I love chocolate | I mean, we can see your post history. It looks like today, you already tried promoting a delish article about a Martha Stewart documentary and something about Crumbl cookies. The above comment specifically might not be self-promotion, but your account is. It's disingenuous to pretend that your writers are posting from a corporate account instead of their personal ones out of the goodness of their hearts."
Burnt Pepperoni Cups Overload - DSP Other Than Prince St. / Emmy Squared?,"Prince St. Pizza has been our favorite the past few times we have visited NYC but we are looking to expand and discover some other spots. What is your favorite spot for Detroit-style pizza with jam packed thick cut pepperonis all crisped and slightly burned on the edges pizza other than Prince St in NYC / Manhattan? We have also been to Emmy Squared and loved it so... more recommendations please!

Edit: EMILY is where I’ve been and loved not Emmy Squared!","Aces in Williamsburg and Rockefeller center | Mama's Too! Is fantastic | Made in New York Pizza (mult. locations) was started by a former employee of Prince Street using the same recipes, supposedly | [https://www.lionsandtigersandsquares.com](https://www.lionsandtigersandsquares.com) | Mimi’s square pepperoni slice, UES. Much better than Prince’s or Emmy Squared IMO, but don’t tell the trendy downtown transplants it would shatter their worldview that nothing good happens north of 14th st. | Square pizza does not automatically equate Detroit style folks. | Mamas Too is my favorite pizza in NYC period.

FWIW, I know it’s an actual Detroit-chain, but Jets Pizza is damn good. | I think Paulie Gee’s in Greenpoint has Detroit style Logan squares | Mos General and Aces in Williamsburg! | Nate's Pizza on Court St. Brooklyn. | Unregular pizza | Mama’s too, Village Square, Burratta, and a few others are all basically the same square slice as Prince st. <Cough> they all totally didn’t just take each others recipes,  and have staff that worked at different pizza spots, that would never happen | Nate’s in Brooklyn | Lions, Tigers, and Squares. 23rd St. best Detroit style pizza in New Yawk. | Let’s not forget Prince street is racist so there’s that | Ace’s. Prince Street is not Detroit style. | This is my vote. I was in the line there once and there was some sort of delay that was holding everything up, so they passed out boats of the cooked pepperoni cups and toothpicks so we could snack in line. It was glorious. | [removed] | Just had the pepperoni square at Mama’s Too… Definite NOT as good as Prince St! The sauce is not as good (kinda bland). My wife says it has “not enough cheese”. Just not “the best pizza I’ve ever tasted” vibe which Prince St always gives. Sorry! Thanks for the suggestions but this is me (and my wife’s) opinion. | I’m rarely disappointed by Made in NY. Not TikTok trendy so no lines around the block either! | They put like honey or some other kind of substance on their square pepperoni slice which I really don't like | Why did it take me this long to scroll to this? | Mimi's is great! I tried their plain slice a while back and I'm ready to put them up there with Joe's / OG Patsy's / NY Pizza Suprema | Mimi’s is a true hidden gem | [deleted] | [deleted] | that sesame seed crust slaps! | Yes!!! Jets is actually from Detroit!! Oddly enough it’s mediocre in Michigan but really good here lol | I used to fly to the Detroit area for work and I got to try Jet's there. They're legitimately good for what they are | They do not | Mamas Too is very different from Prince St. 

Mamas is closer to actual Detroit style IMO because of the crispy edges. | While I thought Prince st was slightly better, we really enjoyed Mama's. But we've only had it once, sounds like you've had it multiple times so you probably know what you're talking about. That's your favorite place? | This 100%. It's become my go-to for a solid, no-frills slice. | aces! | Emmy's does Detroit style, which is very different than grandma style, other than the fact that its rectangular | Yeah I have a lot of family there and go frequently.  The Jets here in NYC is pretty much the same in quality. Worth it for those who want a break from the classic NY style once in a while."
What are cuisines/dishes that are most lacking in NYC?,"For a city with arguably more food options than anywhere else in the country, which foods, either entire cuisines or specific dishes, do you think are hardest to find in NYC?

For me, personally, its BBQ and Cuban sandwhiches.  Yes, I know there are a few spots, but they are few and far between and decent, at best, compared to southern states and Southern Florida respectively.  

edit: TIL we’re lacking so much","Bbq could be better. 

Some places are decent but holy hell is it expensive. | Cajun/Creole. I feel like I can count on one hand how many places there are in the whole city. | Southern food yeah. I think that’s a big one. It’s hard to get real Irish food here as someone who spent my first ten years in Ireland. Most pubs here serve quesadillas and wings, not that I blame them bc that’s probably more popular. | I wish there was better pho. | Vietnamese by far. It's the one thing I truly miss from living in Southern California. You can get by on good enough Mexican food in Queens and Brooklyn these days, though without the regional variety that LA has. | Okinawan, there used to be 3, now 0. | I used to live in the Bay Area and the one cuisine I really miss is Burmese food! | Street and cart food. Pre pandemic you had some great food trucks with a lot of variety of food. Now they’re like 60% halal carts, 20% Mexican food, 10% breakfast food, 5% classic New York, 5% everything else. There’s no variety and it doesn’t help that instead of releasing their licenses people just sell them on the black market. That’s the actual reason the backlog isn’t moving.

Good southern/soul food. Been on a heavy decline since 2010s. There was an amazing place in Williamsburg and almost every church in Harlem sold plates on Sundays. The migration to Atlanta and rising rent costs killed that cuisine in New York. 

Old school Hong Kong and Taiwan cuisines. 

Pakistani food, most people don’t remember but there was a canteen above the mosque on 29th st with the most delicious food. | Not enough affordable Hungarian food. | TexMex, also Colorado/NM green chili | Malay/Singaporean/Indonesian in general. Also would be great to have more Banh Mi places. | Colorado, New Mexico or Southern California style Mexican food. Huge hole and huge opportunity. | Nicaraguan. fritanga would blow up here. there’s none of it. | Hawaiian BBQ.  Nooretuh is fine, but I would kill for a casual lunch takeout place with a good loco moco. | As a New England native, I really miss fried whole belly clams! | Armenian food is nowhere to be found | I wish there was West Indian food in Manhattan.  It’s in queens and bk and Bronx obviously, but guyanese and trini food is so damn good.  Dont think there’s a lick of guyanese food in Manhattan.  Last I checked, we are the 5th largest group of immigrants NYC, from a county of less than a million.   

Atleast there’s a datz deli | Vietnamese is very strongly Chinese-inflected in NYC so the flavor profiles don’t quite hit,

Also lacking distinct Cambodian, Lao, and Hmong cuisines. I wish there were more Malaysian places to choose from too. | Hawaiian Lau Lau. You can find poke, but not Lau Lau. :( | New Orleans/ Cajun Cuisine | Cambodian food, i hate that i have to drive all the way to philly to get cambodian style pho (katiew) | BBQ for sure | The poke in NYC is god awful.  Not that I think any place outside of hawaii could do better. | Viet, Persian, Mexican and BBQ are known to be less good in NYC | Mongolian!! | street food - the city is ruining everything by not granting permits | Ceviche! | Portuguese. Even Ironbound in Newark whcih seem to be leaning Brazilian recently | actually good indian that isn’t a fancy restaurant | The spanish food that is decent here is terribly overpriced | Persian food. | There's plenty of good Thai in the city but it's been impossible to find pad Thai that tastes Thai rather than American ever since Pok Pok Phat Thai closed (in 2016!!) | Egyptian food is extremely hard to find in Nyc. I know of Little Egypt in Astoria, but haven't been able to find other spots outside of that neighborhood with Egyptian food. | fried chicken. a lot of it is passable but haven’t had much luck finding crispy, juicy, seasoned, spicy, hot fried chicken in nyc as i’ve had in the south | I have lived in NYC for 30 years and I am still looking for a Latvian restaurant. | Shanghainese/Taiwanese breakfast. Chifantuan in particular is my favorite, and there’s a few places that have it but none of them are that good. | Hawaiian | For me it’s northeastern seafood dishes.  Such as chowdas, fried seafood and lobster dinners. | I used to live in the UK and real fish n chips is one of the most decadent things you can eat. I haven’t found any that’s particularly good here. A Salt and Battery is mid. | Native American food. | Ethiopian | Proper charcoal pollo ala brass, and Persian | Turkish Ice Cream. Very specific I know, but I've had it in both Turkey and Montreal, and goddamn is it good. | Hot chicken from the south | I'm pretty surprised that there aren't more Cuban offereings in NYC given the city's connection to South Florida, and that good Cuban is relatively cheap and easy to make.  Like the fact that good Cuban sandwhiches are so scarce in NYC is weird to me.  It's really not that complicated. | I was surprised by the lack of authentic Peruvian food when I was there, couldn’t find any tbh | Mexican big time. | Mexican food. Like a regular ole Mexican restaurant you’d find in a southern state. Nothing fancy and no not a street taco joint | Filipino soup dishes.  Only Sinigang is in restaurants. Most meals in Filipino restaurants are the fried and other unhealthy dishes.

* **Sinigang** – A sour soup, usually with pork, shrimp, salmon, or fish, flavored with tamarind, tomatoes, and vegetables.
* **Bulalo** – Beef shank soup with bone marrow, cooked with corn, potatoes, and cabbage.
* **Tinola** – A ginger-based chicken soup with green papaya and chili leaves.
* **Lomi** – A thick noodle soup with egg noodles, pork, shrimp, and vegetables, thickened with cornstarch.
* **Batchoy** – A hearty noodle soup from Iloilo with pork, liver, and chicharrón, topped with raw egg.
* **Pochero** – A tomato-based stew with beef, saba bananas, and vegetables like potatoes, green beans, and cabbage.
* **Molo Soup** – A pork dumpling soup from Iloilo, similar to wonton soup with garlic and toasted garlic toppings.
* **Arroz Caldo** – A comforting rice porridge flavored with ginger and often served with chicken and hard-boiled eggs.
* **La Paz Batchoy** – A rich noodle soup with pork, liver, intestines, and a savory broth, often garnished with garlic and scallions.
* **Kansi** – A soup from the Visayas region, similar to sinigang but with a tangy flavor from batuan fruit and beef.
* **Papaitan** – A soup with goat innards, flavored with bile for a distinct bitter taste.
* **Nilaga** – A clear soup with boiled beef or pork, cabbage, potatoes, and saba bananas. The Korean soup, Galbi-Tang, is a good alternative as they are nearly exactly the same in flavor with Nilaga. | Green chili, New Mexico / Colorado style. I moved here from Denver which has a pretty awful food scene but the one thing I do miss is a green chili plate from efrain’s | Neighborhood Jewish delis. I don't need the Katz experience.

Old-fashioned Greek-managed diners | Sri Lankan Tamil food. I miss it a lot. | Crab cakes.  I’m from Baltimore, and I’ve never found a decent crab cake outside of Maryland.  God knows I’ve tried.  Any NYC recommendations are welcome. | Bolivian food, but mostly salteñas. Bolivia Llama Party didn’t taste that great to me the two times I’ve been, at least in comparison to the Bolivian places outside DC (eg. Falls Church, VA). 

It is a bit niche, and gives me a reason to travel to DC I suppose. | Definitely Creole/Cajun. | Weirdly, as a Puerto Rican, I'm always disappointed by the Puerto Rican food options here in New York. There are a small handful of okay places but, compared to the overall number of Boricuas here, the percentage of PR restaurants is so, so low. And when you complain you're likely to get ""my abuela makes better anyway"" which is fine if you still have your abuela but I don't. I've had to just make food myself which is probably better in the long run, but not convenient. | It’s interesting there’s no fine dining for Colombian food. There’s lots of fine dining in Colombia itself | Another one is Moroccan. Are there any moroccan restaurants? I only know of Cafe Mogador. | Anything Southeast Asian. 

I just find most of the food tasting really weak. I understand that most Westerners aren’t used to bold flavors and/or “stinky” ingredients, so I get why most SEA food is watered down.

But it’s just really upsetting that most Westerners view Japanese food as “fancy” Asian food because they tend to lean “cleaner” and “simpler.” So then SEA cuisine is modified to also be “cleaner” to accommodate the Western palette. 

In reality, spices, flavoring, and ingredient variety is considered a mark of “good” food in many Asian cultures, and especially in SEA cuisine. If you want to look cheap or inhospitable, you skimp on the ingredients that you’re ultimately offering. | Sometimes I feel like this question is actually what food is Manhattan missing | British Indian | Some may call me crazy, but for the amount of places.. The Mexican is primarily pretty eh, with a few exceptions | Chilean sandwiches! When I lived in Boston, there was a great spot, and I was shocked that I couldn't find any places in Manhattan to get one. | Mexican burritos | N’awlins food-poboys, Cajun, creole, etc. | Hawaiian | Oaxacan food! God what I would do for an order of Enmoladas or a Tlayuda! | Southern, bbq and Tex Mex. | Brazilian cuisine | Nigerian or West African food | BBQ, definitely. | Mexican food! All Mexican food here is mid | Korean shaved ice like Sulbing’s version (dessert restaurant chain in Korea).  Haven’t found similar snow texture in Manhattan. | We just got back from 5 nights in NYC. My daughter is obsessed with pho so we did some searching and it was hard to find any Vietnamese restaurants with descent reviews. We ended up finding a spot and it was the worse pho I've had. Totally flavorless | Good Persian | Hush puppies and fried okra | mexican, bbq, ethiopian, vietnamese | NYC needs to up the ante with its tacos, and Mexican food generally. Still has nothing on Cali. | High quality Middle Eastern casual eats, i.e. grass-fed meats and vegan options. | It's gotta be Pakistani. | Restaurants with food from Kerala, India. There are restaurants in the South Indian / Sri Lankan category but they don’t really have dishes from Kerala and there aren’t enough solely Kerala spots. | Mexican | Mexican | I keep hearing about the pho situation in New York, but are there any areas in the United States that does Vietnamese well? | Actual teriyaki… was blown away by the legit options in Seattle for instance. | Mable’s smokehouse is pretty damn good | Cuban food here is woeful.    
Very decent BBQ can be found, all kinds too. | Agreed BBQ can be better. There were great Cuban-Chinese restaurants back in 1980's. | Houstonian here, so far I would say Cajun/creole. I also need to find a good soul food shrimp Mac and cheese place here lol | Goan and Macanese food. | Mexican Food. | There is a ton of indian food but very generalised, there are no specific traditional cuisine like authentic gujarati food, maharashtrian food etc. |  Better baos. Still can’t find anything that hits like Orlando’s King Bao. Vietnamese in general is lacking here | [deleted] | Breakfast tacos are lacking in nyc! | As a native-New Yorker of Cuban descent, yes, Cuban sandwiches but Cuban food as a whole.

There is not a single Cuban restaurant in NYC that actually nails classic criollo cooking. The ones that existed have all closed up shop, and the only ones remaining that come close are Chino-Latino, which admittedly do come quite close. But it's not the same.

Folks ask me all the time ""where do I get good Cuban food?"" I tell them to go to New Jersey (Union City/Weekhawken specifically). | Serbian !!! | Southern food is absolutely pathetic in the city. If yall try and serve me your north eastern ass twist on biscuits and gravy one more time … | Vietnamese. Gotta go to Philly for top-tier pho | I find that regional food from the USA somehow is never done well in nyc. Bbq here sucks sure we have like two decent spots, same with cheesestakes we have like two good ones. I used to think biscuits were the worst food, until I went to the south and realized it’s just that ny can’t make a good biscuit. I guess it’s like when we get a bagel outside of the 5 boros and allways find em trash. | Vietnamese food 😭
Recently realized I haven’t had a decent pho since moving to the NYC area | Donuts. Especially maple bars. | Hawaiian or Samoan food | How many times will “mid” be said? See if you can play a drinking game and survive. | Hungarian. The Budapest Cafe is a total disappointment. | Vietnamese | don't shoot me, but, italian. not italian-american, but italian food of italy. simple dishes with high quality ingredients. 

there's an abundance over any other city of the cuisine that italian immigrants ended up coming up with when they immigrated here. but even places that advertise that they make food of emilia-romagna, veneto, even a lot of what's advertised as ""napoletano""... something is just... off. i can only truly think of one place i've been to, in staten island that had food that even remotely reminded of italy | I've tried a few of the Argentine places and honestly they've all been mediocre, so I'll go for that (disclaimer, I'm Argentine). | I came back from Switzerland and realized that I couldn’t find the dishes I had. 

British Indian food hits different and is better than the Indian food here.

Also, for a big Puerto Rican population, you would think it would be easier to find mallorcas | Central Asian (Mongolian, Uzbek, Kazakh, etc.) food. Baltic (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia) cuisine too - there are several dishes that are very different from Russia's - and I cannot find them here at all. | Peruvian ceviche. Nothing in the city seems to hit. I’d also say Mexican is subpar for the biggest city in the country. | I've never found a Dutch restaurant in NYC | Tunisian | Texas-style breakfast tacos. There’s King David Tacos, and they’re decent, but they’re half as good as any decent Austin chain like Torchy’s - let along the special ones. | Fish tacos | My family’s Spanish and there are very few Spanish restaurants, but that’s to be expected I guess. La Nacional is fantastic, though. | donuts, vietnamese/pho, american chinese, most asian food, mexican

i'm comparing these to west coast/LA places | Indian.  It’s just not as good as elsewhere. | Posted this before - without answering answer:

Where can I get Maultaschen in NYC? | NYC has the best food, but I think a Biscuitville (southern chain of, well, fast food biscuits) would kill here. | Tex-Mex and BBQ | Buffalo wings, bbq, vietnamese, Seattle teriyaki | Reallly really goood 국밥집 gukbap like i have to go to queens | Soul food. | Proper, authentic, fish & chips.

(and please don't tell me dame, or a salt & battery are authentic, because they simply are not). | Pho pho pho pho pho... Please someone move here and give us good pho. | Native american cuisine | LIBERIAN FOOD! Maima’s in Queens was singularly holding it down for so long, but since they’ve closed there hasn’t been anything else to take its place. After it closed I was still going to her apartment to get the food, but that ended too 😩 | Soul food. Good soul food. The soul food that exists tends to have a strong Caribbean flavor profile, and other places I've tried have often lacked authenticity since the owners grew up here and have lost the flavors their parents brought from the South. And I enjoy Caribbean food, but it's not the same as the soul food I want. It's been rare to find great mac and cheese here, macaroni pie is honestly so upsetting 😩 | Name me the best breakfast burrito. Because I’ve been searching for ages | Laotian?  Malaysian? | Garbage plates | local or native hawaiian | What a great thread!!!! | Ethiopian. Also agree with the others on Vietnamese, after living in the city for so many years I’d hoped to find my go-to pho place by now. | Fete Sau in Williamsburg has good bbq, Mabel’s, | I can't find Seattle-style teriyaki. | OP, figured I'd mention that Margon in Times Sq makes a great Cuban sandwich and media noche - albeit not the same way they make it down in Miami or Tampa! I think NYC in general does it a little differently than the ""traditional"" Florida/Cuban style... | Definitely New England cuisine | 100% Cuban sandwiches. 

No, Margon is not it. | Brazilian food, especially from Bahia and Minas Gerais. | Mexican:

mariscos (seafood) 

northern (Sonora, Chihuahua states) 

Thai | Queso | Finnish. You just can’t get a good Vorshmack in this town. And forget about tappaiskeitto, I dunno if you can even find a *bad* one. | Margon in midtown makes a solid Cuban | Cajun food outside of boils | East African cuisine! | Yall got good Malay/Singaporean spots that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg at Urban hawker | NYC is missing more “affordable” diverse cuisine. I use affordable in quotes bc it’s all relative. I’m referring to more casual restaurants that have appetizers between $10-$15 and entrees maxing out around $25. | Vietnamese here is not great. | Tex-Mex | Pho is less good than I would expect. Cleveland has better pho | Jersey and I thought parts of Manhattan had plenty of Cuban food? But the real answers are Vietnamese, Hawaiian/Polynesian, regional Southern food, New Californian, and not as much British or Irish options as you’d imagine. | Paneer Tikka Masala....have yet to find one I really like. | Latvian and Baltic food options | I've never had a good cuban croqueta in New York, it's absolutely tragic | No great Indian food | Peruvian that isn’t high end or casual | Nicaraguan!!! | North African: Algerian, moroccan, etc. | pretzels | Peruvian imo | Kenyan!! Not broad east african, but a place for just kenyan food 😭 | Vietnamese | California Burritos. WTH | - Nigerian. The few that I’ve tried are either overpriced, lacking in taste or flavor, have a limited menu, or have genuinely terrible service. 

- African cuisines in general, to be honest. 

- BBQ. 

- I’m surprised New Orleans/Creole food doesn’t have a bigger presence here. 

- Genuinely good pierogies. Streecha had the best I’d tasted and were well-priced, but the OG kitchen closed. Veselka pierogies were some of the worst I’d ever had, everything else is really expensive ($12+ for 6 pierogies). 

- French Canadian food (eg. Poutine) | Can't get a proper Doner Kebab anywhere.
No savory pastries: sausage rolls, Cornish pasties, Scotch eggs etc | TIL we’re not lacking anything lol every response is “I miss X, I mean yeah this place in Queens/brooklyn is fantastic but I wish it was closer!” | No good Moroccan food | Breakfast tacos | A solid Italian beef. Maybe it's just not economically viable anymore... | Hawaiian. | It’s so funny for me to hear about how folks find BBQ lacking in NYC. 25 years ago the only option for BBQ was a bar in Queens because the city didn’t allow smokers. It’s only when smoker technology improved that we got Blue Smoke, Fette Sau and so many of the other places that followed. 

I agree that bbq is better in the places it came from, but NYC bbq is still pretty good. | Burmese food!!! If anyone knows of a place similar to Burma Superstar please let me know. I also haven’t found many great pupusa places, any recommendations?? | Tatar food. I’ve managed to find one Georgian lady who sells a version of some Tatar pastries on the street in Brighton Beach, but she uses beef instead of duck (understandable, duck is expensive.) Tatars (specifically Volga Tatars) are the second largest ethnic group in Russia, so I thought surely Brighton Beach would have a Tatar place. :(  | Vietnamese and Mexican | Persian food | \+1(,000) to Vietnamese. Comfort Japanese food that is not sushi or ramen (e.g. okonomiyaki, oyakodon, hiyashi chuka, etc.), Korean food that isn't BBQ (naengmyun, ddeokguk, jjajangmyeon), Chinese food that isn't Cantonese or Fujianese (Sichuan, Xinjiang, etc.). | Burritos, fish tacos, BBQ | vegetarian here so coming with a different perspective! 

in general a lot of cuisines exist but they don’t have a lot of the “authentic” dishes in vegetarian format. (for instance soup dumplings, or certain dimsum menus, japanese homestyle katsu/noodles, etc) i know not every restaurant is required to cater to all dietary needs or preferences but it would be nice to go to a cheap or authentic spot and be able to eat something other than sides sometimes!! that being said there truly are many options for veggie folks, it’s just a bit more research that needs to go in than some other folks without dietary needs/prefs :) *this would be in an ideal world*

some fun sub-cuisines:
- shojin ryori (japanese temple cuisine)
- korean temple cuisine
- more south indian homestyle restaurants
- homestyle meals from various cultures
- filipino or thai dessert places | I love NYC but I haven’t had any Mexican/Tex Mex that’s blown me away. | Good Mexican food. | American AYCE Buffet | Baked cannabis edibles | Chicago style Italian beef sandwich. | You’re not looking hard enough for BBQ. I’ve been to KC, North Carolina and TX. The best BBQ I’ve had is in NYC. A lot of the restaurants are run by top chefs from the south.

For Cuban sandwiches try a Dominican spot. | Cajun/Creole and Soul Food | Indonesian. Haven’t found anything authentic and consistent. | Diversity in African food! There’s a couple of Ethiopian and Nigerian spots but very few Liberian, Senegalese, Cameroonian, Guinean, etc | Lebanese | Cambodian, really good Mexican, better Vietnamese, Laotian, Burmese etc. But from this post I know to catch a train to Philly for Vietnamese and Cambodian. Moroccan food is sorely missing too; there is some good food, but it lacks that special flavor you only get in Morocco, at someone's house.  There also seem to be fewer Indo-Chinese places unless you go to deep Queens. | Laotian food. I tried to find really good, authentic papaya salad and no luck. | CUBAN FOOD ASF. Moved here from FL. I wont buy overpriced mid cuban food here NO SIR | Not nearly enough good Tex-Mex or New Mexican food in New York. Plenty of good examples of regional Mexican, but the border cuisines - including Sonoran - feel underrepresented to me.

Also, there are a couple of solid Afghan places in Queens and BK, but nothing like one can find around DC and Baltimore. | Nothing really | My dad grew up in Union City and North Bergen in NJ, and honestly, I’d recommend going across the river if you want good, cheap Cuban food.

I also agree with BBQ, and then also adding Tex Mex. I went to college in Houston and there are definitely a few cuisines that it does better. | Mexican/ Cuban / English (full breakfast) / bbq | Same.. bbq and Cuban | Mexican also needs work | Mexican | More west African restaurants. | Real tex-mex. No avant garde shit just real good tex mex | Mexican food | I know I’ll be downloaded to oblivion, but it’s breakfast sandwiches.

I can’t blame someone for thinking NYC is somehow superior in the BEC game just because you can get them everywhere, but most are incredibly mediocre, and I’m saying this as someone who’s lived in NYC for almost 20 years.

I go to CT a lot, and in just one single town there are at least spots I can think of with the most perfect breakfast sandwiches. Somehow each place manages to have their own subtle spin on the classic bacon egg and cheese, so it’s actually fun to change it up often. There’s no favorite spot for me because each spot hits the spot in its own special way. I wish everyone on this planet could try a sandwich from The Tasty Yolk. Every time I take the first bite it’s like a mouthgasm of comfort and flavor. This photo doesn’t do it justice but you might get the idea it’s fucking amazing:

https://res.cloudinary.com/gonation//w_2000/q_auto/f_auto/gonation.data.prod/item/itm-JDsoo3XwTlS0sl7i2ZUFoQ/abm-33Z7LGI7RF6-0pwYSggDyw/img-ddBz0c4xS6mhxrBdq1fLCQ-full.png

And it’s like 7 bucks. So worth it for how filling and satisfying they are.

I so wish NYC could get a taste of what these CT sandwiches are like. Quality ingredients, affordable, by default they all use fried eggs rather than the lazy default scrambled bullshit you get almost everywhere in the city, the bacon is consistently cooked properly and doesn’t taste cheap, and they all use white American cheese, which is much harder to come by in NYC. It’s the superior cheese for these sandwiches. I’ll die on this hill. Yellow American is best for burgers and chopped cheeses. | Truly you guys need to leave Manhattan and head deep into the other 4 boroughs, I promise you’ll find at least 1 restaurant that will crave your taste of home | Everyone saying Mexican is absolutely buggin | Good Italian is lacking in NYC. Plenty of Italian American but little to no Italian. Also lacking in good Ethiopian cuisine | Mexican and Tex Mex. | Mable’s in Williamsburg is fire bbq | Most of the provinces in China are horrendously underrepresented, but this is generally true in the West.  | Persian food. Have to pay up the nose for some middling plate or actually go to a dense population outside the city | Cambodian food! | Good BBQ and Mexican. | admittedly, I'll give BBQ a slight pass seeing as how good BBQ benefits greatly for having a lot of outdoor space for smoking.  Big reason why Hometown is kind of the king. | I'll put Dinosaurs bbq wings up against just about anybody's | I’ve eaten at Fette Sau a few times. I thought it was pretty good 👍🏽 | The one thing about BBQ, and why folks will be up
In arms here, is that the the number one indication of a good spot is consistency in how good it is. It’s easy to make good BBQ once a day, but for it to all turn out great is another level. That’s why I think you’ll hear some people say BBQ in nyc is good, because they went at a lucky time, others not so much. In Texas, it tends to stay consistent, at least with the top places. | Blue Smoke is closing and it’s genuinely affecting my mood | You can find food from countries like Ethiopia and Burma in NYC but you can’t find BBQ. It’s so ridiculous. | John Brown's is the only place I've found is consistent, but expensive. | Pig Beach BBQ Queens | I really like Lowerline in Brooklyn | This might sound crazy but if you’re ever around Rye NY (metro north ride, like 50 min maybe), there is a hole in the wall called Rye Roadhouse that does amazing Cajun/creole. They even have the blackened gator bites. Coming from someone who has taken trips down to nola for a weekend just to grub & come back 🤣 | came here to say this. po-boys, shrimp and grits, gumbo, jambalaya...just tough to find any good options | And none are very good. We had a glut of them in the late 80s to mid 90s, but too many were mediocre or worse, just pumping out blackened salmon (after the redfish population collapsed) that was actually just burned and flavorless, slimy gumbo. But there were good restaurants too; heck, K-Paul's had a branch here that opened as a popup in 1985 and later a full restaurant in 89. | strange delights is excellent! | Have you tried Alligator Pear on W 30th? I thought it was decent, even though it's a little high end. | I had a positive impression of Sugar Freak in Astoria | I think for Irish food you’d have to go to Woodlawn or woodside | Pies and Thighs has been it holding it down for a while, but I do miss Brooklyn Star.  And Jimmy's Diner had some good southern plates.  Damn what happened? | The Blasket in east midtown is owned and run by Irish guys and makes a point of including some Irish food alongside the usual stuff: sausage rolls, shepherd’s pie, potato and leek soup, fish and chips, an Irish-style breakfast sandwich, and curry French fries which is kind of a genius idea IMO | Irish: Dead Rabbit pub. Butcher’s Block in Sunnyside (it’s an Irish grocery). | Decent fish n chips is my white whale in NYC. | Mollys on ~23rd/3rd | Peaches (the original) on Lewis Ave in Bedstuy has incredible Southern food. Agreed with another poster that Brooklyn Star was legit! | Anywhere you recommend for Irish food? | Bed-stuy has good soul food Peaches and Blessings to name a couple | Cafe Camellia in bk does great southern food. | So true. I've tried potato salad and collard greens here from so many places, and it's always sad. | As a Việt, most places in NYC are mid. | I've lived in Nashville and Seattle, and their pho blows NYC's out of the water. I've tried tons of different places here and have rarely been impressed. I also lived in Sydney, which is just on a whole other level (as is most of their Asian cuisine) so it's unfair to compare... | Actually NYC does better on Pho than on other Vietnamese dishes, which are either mid or just not available. Vietnamese is a serious weakness in NYC, even relative to Boston and Philly. | Worth a trip to the Bronx:
Cóm Tám Ninh Kiéu | Maybe I'm a pleb and don't know the nuance between good and great pho, but I've had pretty good luck with it in Manhattan. I live close to Sao Mai which I love, but have had really good pho at random places throughout midtown and chinatown.

Had a lot more trouble finding it when I lived in Bed-stuy though. | I’ve had pho in other cities that are touted as good (Houston specifically) and hated it. It’s probably a taste profile difference. Most run of the mill Viet restaurants in NYC are owned by Chinese-Viets | The pho at Banh (UWS/Morningside) is solid!! Try their banh xeo &  spring rolls too | I eat loads of good Pho here...have I not been eating good pho? | Worth a trip to the Bronx:
Cóm Tám Ninh Kiéu | As an Australian who has lived in one of the most vibrant Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam. NY sucks the big one. The best here is just meh. Yet Thai food is freaking spectacular.
I need an answer for this and it’s probably the west coast, right? | Ironically enough, Tènten has the most authentic Northern cuisine I’ve had in the entire country. I know Southern cuisine is much more popular but you can go to Philly for that. | And this is why I keep eating Vietnamese when I travel! | if you go to the right places in bk the mexican food can be as good as la or mexico, but you gotta know what to get where. i'll get tongue and chorizo here, cemitas there, barbacoa or panza negra at another place, picaditas at a different place, quesadillas someplace else. hard to find excellent pastor (cue the flames from the no 1 fans), we don't do asada fries, hard to find mexican hot dogs. agree on the lack of regional variety-nyc is like 97% poblano food.

and nailed it on the viet thing-my wife is from the bay area and the vietnamese food out there is MILES BETTER than anything in nyc (except for maybe the bbq pork banh mi at little thanh da in sunset park). | I've never even heard of that. How is it different than the rest of Japanese cuisine? | Heno Heno in Hells kitchen | As a half Okinawan, I’d love to find a place to take my mom! | I literally made the trek out from Manhattan to Elmhurst in Queens to get Burmese food in a mall food court (Burmese Bites, it's great, they're also at the Queens Night Market) because I was craving it so much one day. Little Myanmar downtown is also solid but a bit pricey. | I had a friend that worked at Burma Superstar - it was a stop with every visit for sure | Burmese Bites in the Queens Center Mall is excellent. | Came here to see if Burmese food was mentioned! | My husband says Little Myanmar is pretty decent when he misses his mom’s cooking. | Burma superstar is the shit out in sf | defintely not enough, but Rangoon is solid.  the tea leaf salad is dope. | There was a tasty Burmese stall in the final iteration of the Elmhurst food court but I’m not sure if they’ve moved elsewhere since it shuttered. | Little Myanmar in the east village is good albeit overpriced for what it is as portions are fairly modest. But its authentic for sure | Haven’t gotten to try yet but there’s a new Burmese (+ some other cuisines, but the chef/owners are from Myanmar!) in Bay Ridge called Burmese Harp that I’m really excited to try! 

Bonus that you could take the ferry then take a walk through the park along Shore Road before cutting over to get there :) | the declining southern food gap is crazy one i didn’t even realize until mentioned here.  these liberals need to wake up. | If you’re referring to Taste of Heaven in Williamsburg, it’s still there! | I was just thinking the other day that a dedicated biscuits-and-gravy cart could do well on late nights in the Village, on the LES, etc.  Or maybe have 2 options, b&g and fried chicken sandwich w/gravy.  Offer pepper+hot sauce as a ""spicy"" option. I bet it could work. | Probably you’re referring to savory dishes, but I absolutely love Andre’s Hungarian Bakery in Forest Hills! | I’d kill for a good egg/bacon/hash brown/green chile breakfast burrito in Manhattan. It doesn’t seem to exist :( I know there’s a few spots in Brooklyn, but they’re a far ass trek. And not quite the same. I miss being able to get an amazing $4 breakfast burrito anywhere, the way I could in NM. | Def not a ton of NM but Santa Fe BK is doing its best | The lack of true TexMex here is one of the worst parts of the city. 

Some places claim to be, but they’re either too fancy or too authentically Mexican.

I want cheap, basic TexMex food that I can smother in queso and that reminds me of being south of the Mason Dixon. For whatever reason nobody in the city can do it.

We lost the chains in Covid that kind of fit the bill. (RIP Moe’s, Chevy’s, and Blockheads…) | Javelina is pretty decent Tex-Mex. | I already answered ""Mexican"" to this post before stumbling upon your answer.

My husband grew up in Texas, and he's sorely disappointed by the lack of Mexican/TexMex options in NYC. I lived in TX with him for a bit, and I can't blame him. Anytime we see queso on a menu, we get our hopes up and are let down. It's usually just some basic melted cheese, and they're charging $14 for it.

Some of the highest-rated Mexican/TexMex restaurants in the city wouldn't know Mexican if it bit them in the a**. | hjobra on 4th ave | try elmhurst in queens… singaporean friend said best malay food he’s had outside of SE Asia | just had some very solid Indo last week in Elmhurst actually.  Sumatera. | For Indo you gotta go to Qns.

In Brooklyn (Sunset Park-ish) I like Hainan Chicken House. There are others, but they're not great.

Manhattan - my standards are Nyonya (hit/miss) and Kopitiam | My family has been going to Taste Good in Elmhurst for decades, if you want good Malaysian. Still struggling to find a good laksa (Singapore-style) though... maybe I just prefer the way my family makes it.

For Indo, we like Sky Cafe but their Philly location is much better... as is Philly's Indo food in general. Worth the trip down there if you are really missing it. | There's a good Malay spot with an excellent reasonably priced Nasi Lemak among other things called Curry House. Would recommend heavily. | Laut for Malay is really good. | check out Santa Fe BK, but I agree with this otherwise. | Have you tried Ursula in BK (for New Mexico) or Electric Burrito (for SoCal style Mexican)? I think they're solid, albeit not particularly mindblowing. | Dorado near Union Square is pretty close to better ish SoCal burrito shops. For SoCal/San Diego/arizona 

Skip electric burrito. It’s hot garbage. Its like someone thought they knew what this food was and tried to make it without ever actually having it or knowing what they are doing

Dorado | I don’t think there’s one Nicaraguan place here. | Just read that L&L is opening a couple of locations in Manhattan this year. | Oh my god, I miss basically anything from any New England seaside seafood shack. I will probably get a lot of hate for saying this, but when I went to City Island, it wasn't even close. Zero itches scratched. | I’m not from New England but my mother is and I’ve spent a lot of time in Massachusetts (fortunate to have a family beach cottage to go to) and in addition to whole fried belly clams, I’ll add stuffed quahogs. I always make a point to order both at least once when I’m up visiting the house because they do not exist in NYC! | city island ,  crab house on coney island | 😊 I grew up near Woodman’s( world famous!) so I hear that. I get it every now and then when I go back there. I don’t really want to eat it anywhere else though? | I do miss food from New England down here since I've moved I want a good sub shop. The Italian sandwich don't hit the same as a Greek Pizza Shop that makes any type of sub you might want | Always surprises me given it’s not hard to find other Caucasus region food, eg Georgian restaurants in south BK | try little armenia cafe in greenpoint | there's a few in Harlem, but I get that's out the way for most manhattanites | They opened a Peppa's Jerk Chicken in Kips Bay (on 2nd ave between 27th & 28th St), they even sell patties now and have a bigger menu (including saltfish & ackee, callaloo, etc.) on Thurs, Fri, Sat I think.

Oh, and there's a Jamaican food cart across from NYU hospital on 1st Ave and 33rd st. Not as good as what you get in the other boroughs, but they're solid options. | Emhurst Queen got good Malaysian just bring cash. | there’s a history of a couple centuries of chinese-vietnamese in vietnam but go off on flavor profiles l o l | Almost all the viet places are owned by chinese people haha. | BoKy in Chinatown Manhattan is closed but not as good as South Philly. | Yup. Fly to Montreal to get Cambodian at Street Monkeys! | I actually developed a poke recipe that i think replicates hawaiian poke very well! Im going to start a food vendor/cart sometime soon when my licensing comes in. If anyone wants to taste test and order wholesale feel free to pm me! Im in the midtown area. | Las Vegas apparently has quite a substantial Hawaiian community and so pretty good poke. | Agree re: Persian. Ravagh lacks spice to me & their shallot yogurt sauce is bland. Sofreh was too American & ‘Persian inspired’ rather than straight up Persian food. Miraj is pretty bland and under seasoned. Shiraz is ok but still mediocre at best. | There's really good Persian! Eyval, Sofreh, Masquerade! | Can’t speak to Persian, but hard yes on the other 3. | Yeah I haven't been to a Persian restaurant here that really impressed me. There was a decent Ash place though. But I can make better. | I feel like there is a lot of Mexican in NYC.  Maybe it doesnt meet west coast or mexican standards in flavor or price point but its hardly difficult to find. | Brooklyn (sunset park, bushwick etc) for Mexican | Persian... I still miss Pars in Chelsea. | NYC Mexican food is just different than California Mexican food but imo they’re interchangeably good at this point, people are just hung up on how it was like a decade ago here | There’s an authentic Mongolian Food Cart in the park by the W 4th Joes Pizza. He sells buuz, khusvur and milk tea. | Queens is your answer. Absolutely delicious and like $6 in Corona, especially the stalls that set up inside and outside Queens Night Market on Saturday evenings | Leitao in the west village is really good! | True. I hate some of the ""cheaper"" ones that just really really mess up their rice or curries. | Spanish food is heavily based in local seafood and produce, so it’s pretty impossible to make proper Spanish food in the US. The jamon that gets to the US is terrible too! | Wasn’t Pad Thai some sort of cultural diplomacy by thai government? | true bangkok-street pad thai is non existent here for sure.  with the dried shrimps and different kinds of noodles.  I miss that stuff. | Bahary in Bay Ridge, for fish. Zooba, on Kenmare, is as good as the location in Cairo | Premise ridiculous.. who have two potato | Or any Baltic! Have not found Lithuanian or Estonian either. | I think that I've seen a couple Latvian dishes on previous Dacha46 pop up menus, but even then, I think it was earlier days, like in 2020, not recently. | Just read that L&L is opening some spots in the city. | There are none. | I don’t think there’s anywhere here you can get even fry bread | Owamni, if you’re traveling in Minneapolis. | There are more and more Ethiopian restaurants opening up in NYC! I'm going to check them out as I moved back to NYC and no longer have access to my family's homemade injera... | Ghenet in Brooklyn is good. | queen of sheba, bunna cafe are both decent. ethiopian is not really my bag tho | Awash on the UWS is fantastic | +1 for Bunna. Ras in Crown Heights is also solid. | been going to Bunna for years. | Bati is great though. I also know vegan is popular but real clarified butter in ethiopian is clutch. I do miss that | FYI, Antepli in Bay Ridge sells Turkish ice cream. Also good baklava. Apparently it's a chain from Turkey. There's also a location (of course) in Paterson in NJ | Have heard good things about Tico’s in Bushwick! Haven’t tried yet but will eventually, grew up in South Florida and definitely took the ropa vieja/maduros scene for granted | Yea its either mediocre rotisserie chicken or cheffed out food that can be good but doesn’t taste traditional | We had tons of those. | Try Shelsy's on Court and Atlantic | My friend you need to go to Staten Island | Sigiri, Spicy Lanka are both good. Lungi just opened up last month but haven't had the chance to try it | And Mogador isn’t even very authentic | I've heard good things about Dar Umma in Astoria from Moroccan friends but I haven't tried it yet. I travel to Morocco a lot so I am often reminded how bad our choices are in NYC. | There are plenty of cuisines that no borough excels at | Chote Nawab in Murray Hill is fairly good with typical BIR curries. Athithi in Williamsburg also has a section of BIR dishes. | Chacarero in downtown Boston? Awesome lunch spot | L&L is opening a few locations in Manhattan. | I mean you can get good Pakistani food in Coney Island Ave in the Kensington area of Brooklyn. | Orange County, California (all of Southern California but there in particular). | Philadelphia has NY beat in Southeast asian cuisine from top to bottom. | New Orleans has a wildly good selection of Viet cuisine | Seattle! | SF Bay Area | Texas Houston | Boston, everything else there is pretty bad but the Vietnamese is legit. | OMG yes! I don't even live in New York but when this came across my feed I had to comment. Teriyaki (and pho) are the two foods my PNW friends say they miss most in New York. There was an article in the NYT about teriyaki in Seattle and the PNW and how it's unique. Born and raised here and had no idea that it wasn't a ""thing"" everywhere until I was well into adulthood!

I work in an urban/suburban confluence that is pretty much a food desert--but I'm 5 minutes away from no fewer than 4 teriyaki restaurants. Everyone has a favorite and is very impassioned about why their choice is best. Many of them are owned by Korean families so the bulgogi is great, too. | if Dishoom opened a location here it would be game over. | Bronx for that | Queens Blvd in Rego Park for Uzbeki! | What are you talking about? We're even starting to see regional Indian cuisine over the last 5 years. Indian food in NYC is stellar (speaking as an immigrant from India). | yeah! the saravana bhaavan in berlin is so much better than the one here! /s

adda, dhamaka, etc.

all of jackson heights. | Which regional cuisine are you thinking of? | We went to hometown last year, it was 6/10 at best and we paid double comparing to other phenomenal bbq’s in country. I think the bbq throne is still waiting to be claimed in NY. | hometown is >>>>> | Those are definitely great. Have you tried the Alabama White Wings from Blue Smoke? Those are great too. | It's decent but might be the most offensively overpriced of the bunch. | This is my go-to but it’s a bit inconsistent ime | NYC can't even touch the south when it comes to BBQ, which is a shame. I went 23 years not knowing what I was missing until I tried Dickies. My friend from Alabama said ""chill, it's not even that good."" He introduced me to WAY better BBQ. | As a New Orleans native this is the one. | Their crawfish etouffee is the real deal, best NYC restaurant meal I’ve eaten in months! | went to lower line a few days after getting back from a job in NOLA.  Pretty fucking good. | >Coming from someone who has taken trips down to nola for a weekend just to grub & come back 

As someone who does the same, I'm sold. Will be sure to check it out! | Or The Bayou in Mt Vernon! It’s super close to the train station | K-JUN is pretty delicious | I've heard good things about Strange Delight out in BK but haven't made it out there yet, otherwise definitely agree that most are extremely mid.

>K-Paul's had a branch here that opened as a popup in 1985 and later a full restaurant in 89.

I found out years after it closed that we apparently had Jacques Imo's here for a hot second. Missed out on that alligator cheesecake. | Donovan’s! | Second Woodlawn. Many first and second gen immigrants. Also, it's technically Yonkers, but McLean Ave as well. | Sunnyside too. Maaaaaybe Maspeth? | I loved Brooklyn Star! | I will check this out!!! Thank you | I think it's cod | Dead Rabbit and Dame | proper fish and chips with the peas and sauce for sure.  went to london for the first time last year and realized what I had been missing my whole life. | Have you tried A Salt and Battery? I thought it was pretty good, but I have to admit, I haven't been to the UK. I want to know if it's legit or not | White whale is banned in nyc bro | I still live in the area but when I lived at 18th and third (and was younger) I went there pretty often. Great food cool vibe | I find Philly better for Vietnamese tbh | Do you have any that you prefer? | Sydney mentioned 👀

Yes we r another level for asian food. | Much of the south has excellent Viet and Lao scenes. Atlanta, Houston, and Nashville (for its size) are phenomenal. | I didn’t have Viet when I was in Sydney but the pho from Pho Thin in Melbourne was way better than any bowl I had in the US | Where’s the good pho in Boston 👀 | Even Worcester in Massachusetts does better than NYC | I thought NY had good pho until I had some pho spots in Philly and they blow almost everywhere I've had in NY out of the water | Most likely yes, you have not been eating good pho | I’m seeing more places that are raising the bar for nyc viet food the past couple years.

Generally speaking the nyc viet food is sorta average. The main north east viet hub is around falls church virginia if you want to get a good comparison.

One big indicator theres a lot of vietnamese folks is if theres a fresh tofu / fresh viet sweet bean and snacks shop.

My 2 local favs for viet right now in DT BK area is Ha Noi in Park Slope, and Em Vietnamese Bistro out by Brooklyn bridge, only because they actually and properly grill the grilled meat dishes.

Havent tried their pho or bahn mi yet, probably when it gets colder. High hopes but low expectations lol. | The restaurant style bone broth is difficult to make and time consuming. Coupled that with a barely existent Viet population (they tend to like warmer climates like Texas and California), it’s hard to find legit pho in NYC. I’ve had better pho in El Paso. | There's good pho but it's also about 100% more expensive than many other places in the US. | It’s pretty average, and more expensive. Boston has better Viet food, or Philly or VA. It’s also hard to find non-standard offerings in NYC like bun mam (fermented fish soup). Plus there’s no good grocery stores for Vietnamese-specific produce in NYC. Just less percentage of Vietnamese people living here compared to the other cities that others have mentioned. | Lots of pork dishes, tofu made with peanuts, bitter melon dishes and they use awamori instead of sake for cooking. | It just seemed like a regular izakaya...which dishes are Okinawan? | Burmese bites just opened a place in midtown/Murray Hill. On 44th. | That burmese spots is fire. Everyone sleeps on burmese food. | Rangoon closed, I think 😫

Edit: I was only talking about Crown Heights! I didn’t realize there was a Manhattan location - it’s still open! | They used to have a bakery location on first Ave near the 59th st bridge. I was so sad when it closed. You're right though - I'm referring to savory dishes :-) | Tex mex fajitas. Queso. Home made flour tortillas | People keep saying this. I've been, I don't agree | I don’t know that I agree — they cut their fajitas with the grain… | I've tried Asian Taste 86 and Sky Cafe and they were just ok imo. Friendly staff, food seems quite authentic, but the quality of ingredients (meat especially) was fairly mid. May need to try a couple other spots.

Had better luck with Malaysian at Taste Good Malaysian, and of course, the Thai food in the hood is quite good. | I lived in Malaysia, and laut is super legit | Thank you for the suggestions! Both were fine, kinda meh compared to the real thing. | I like Dorado. Their Cali burrito is pretty good but honestly that’s my least favorite part of San Diego style Mexican. 😂 I just find most Mexican here is very dry and lacking that flavor to kick ratio. | Pretty sure I've seen at least one on Roosevelt ave in JH. | 🙌🏽 | Almost all (if not all) West Indian food in Manhattan is Jamaican too. | [deleted] | Please let me know! I'm also in Midtown and would love to taste test and visit | Three expensive fusion-y restaurants (good restaurants for sure, but not traditional) in a city of 8 million. | In my opinion, Masquerade is truly mediocre—I even asked my girlfriend not to judge our cuisine based on that one experience, though maybe we caught them on an off night! Sofreh and Eyval, on the other hand, are incredible. Eyval incorporates southern Iranian influences, offering delicious dishes like Ghalieh Mahi that my relatives don’t often make. I haven’t found a traditional Iranian restaurant in NYC that truly compares with home-cooked meals, so I really appreciate the innovative approaches at Sofreh and Eyval. Nasim Alikhani, the chef behind both restaurants, also has an excellent cookbook. | People tend to forget Mexico is a big country with different regions and each region specializes in different types of foods with different taste profiles. | NYC has just started taking their tortillas seriously in the last year or so, is the thing. Places where they do, the quality has gone way up. | Yeah the Mexican food scene has improved vastly over the last 5 years. I moved here from LA in 2016 and for a few years was unhappy about my choices for fulfilling my Mexican cravings. But there is a bunch of really good new spots that have recently opened, even though some regions are still not well represented here. | Yeah, I feel the Mexican food criticism is overblown because I see a lot of Mexican restaurants now. | The general rule is the closer you are to the Mexican border, the better the Mexican food. California and Texas have better Mexican food than NYC for sure. | [deleted] | Forgot about that place. haven't been. Looks good but expensive ($34 Francesinha!!) but just a small slice of the cuisine. Will try. Thanks. | you're a horrible person, but horribly funny.

great job here | what are we missing?  I dont know anyting about their cuisine | Estonia House East 34th St Manhattan | I miss the croquettas | There’s good Peruvian in Jackson Heights | Both Greek diners and  Jewish delis? | Lakruwana | That's true, it's like French Moroccan, but that's the only place I know where they make tagines. | Lahori Chilli is not bad but I would say nowhere near as good as Pakistani food can be. Are there any others I'm missing? | Definitely some great Nola spots. For people who don’t know, big enough population that you’ll see govt docs and even street signs in French then Vietnamese  | That’s even almost gone. Most of the Puerto Ricans are gone. There are only a handful of cuchifritos in the city – and most aren’t run by Puerto Ricans anymore. I can only think of one or two sit down restaurants. | Is Jackson Heights really a premier destination for Indian food anymore?  | Yeah hometown is so unbelievably overpriced and the quality is mediocre. I don’t understand why people praise it so much | Yep, after living in the KC metro then moving to NY and hearing everyone gas up Hometown…when I had it, it was laughably mediocre. New Yorkers just don’t know what good BBQ is. | [deleted] | I would say étouffée is a dish that I’ve never had in New York City but you can find everywhere in New Orleans. It’s a crying shame that we don’t have that in New York City. | It sure it. Except that's a Korean-Cajun fusion restaurant. None of the dishes I've tried had the specific flavor profile you'd find in Louisiana. | Oh yeah, Jacques-Imo's was a great space with terrific food (though probably not quite as good as the original). Was it right near the Natural History museum? It's been a long time, 2008 maybe... | Lol | Pho 75 is elite in Philly | Yesssss was waiting for this comment | I was always surprised that I felt there was much more of a Vietnamese food scene when I lived in Philadelphia than when I lived in NYC | Also more variety of Vietnamese food in Philly than NYC | Honestly, I try to avoid Việt restaurants because I grew up with a mom who can cook and usually only get Việt food when I'm sick and need phở.

Ba Xuyen in Sunset Park is fucking fire for bánh mì. I always get one and a smoothie when I'm in the area.

I think Phở Best in Flushing and Hello Saigon, Kitchen Cô Út and Bánh in Manhattan were good, but it's been a while and I rarely get phở.

BoKy actually are Chinese Cambodian.    And the grilled beef on the street along 6 street was awesome in South Philly. | Miraj and Ravagh are pretty solid affordable options in the city. | I hope more places keep taking their tortillas seriously. It's key to elevating Mexican food here | Even then, fresh tortillas seem to be far from the norm | my wife (we're both from socal) moved to nyc in 2012 and i remember that decent mexican was really hard to find.  my old boss, born and raised in sf, lived in nyc in the early 90's and he said you couldn't even find a burrito back then. | judicious exultant society person coordinated point workable test tie piquant

Best barbecue ribs and brisket in NYC ,Hi. Traveling NYC soon and need some recommendations for BBQ smoke house to try. Send some recommendations with pictures please ,"One of the more uniquely NYC BBQ joints is Bark Barbecue. They have a really delicious chicharron and brisket sandwich, that blends together Dominican food and Texas BBQ. 

Also, if you happen to pass by a Jamrock Jerk cart, they have fantastic jerk chicken which I would actually say is NYC's BBQ style. | Speaking as a former Texan, they're mostly fine, but nothing hits like it does when I go back home. That said, Hometown BBQ in Red Hook is your best bet for Texan BBQ. John Brown's in LIC does KC style, I believe | I’ll get downvoted, but as a former Texan I really enjoy Hill Country BBQ | Where are you visiting from? Hometown BBQ locations are both fun. Distilleries and breweries at both the red hook and industry city locations. | Skip the bbq. Pastrami is brisket. Go to Katz's or Sarges and get a hot pastrami. | Hometown is the best of the bunch but can’t compete with a good Texas BBQ, Smoked Spice BBQ does it pretty well but he’s doing pop-ups only for now and it’s more of a carribean inspired style | While I agree that NYC isn't better than, say Texas, for BBQ - there are still some places that will do a good job. Morgan's BBQ in Brooklyn is perhaps my top choice. | None of them. 

Bbq in nyc isn’t particularly good. Even the “good” bbq here people recommend is overpriced and controversial how “good” it  actually is

Go eat, like, anything else.  You’ll just be whelmed by bbq here and there’s plenty of amazing food options you don’t need to go to mediocre overpriced ones | [https://ny.eater.com/maps/nyc-best-barbecue-restaurants-brisket-ribs-pulled-pork](https://ny.eater.com/maps/nyc-best-barbecue-restaurants-brisket-ribs-pulled-pork)

BBQ is one of the things I eat least in NYC. Its so expensive. But given the cost of the meat and time to make it, I understand the price point behind it. | don't waste a nyc meal on bbq. | Fette sau is another solid, albeit overpriced, option and it's a cool location. Mables is another bar forward brooklyn option I've had a good experience at | Hometown BBQ makes a stellar beef rib. It’s expensive, but honestly TX BBQ is expensive everywhere. I spent a shit ton at franklins and terry black. I’ve eaten at most of the hot spots in TX (Lockhart,cattleack,salt lick in driftwood, hard eight, pecan lodge, terry blacks, franklins, la barbecue, Hutchins, Micklethwait), and can comfortably recommend Hometown BBQ. 

People shit on hometown because it’s expensive when I spend relatively the same amount at any spot in TX. | NYC has decent BBQ options, but they acutely suffer from the common traps of NYC dining - super long waits times and super high prices. Color me crazy, but I’m not trying to wait in line for 90 minutes at Hometown to get a few slices of above average brisket for $48. If you’re gonna wait a long time and spend (relatively) lots of $, may as well get something that’s both unique to NYC and of higher quality (Asian cuisines, pizza, Katz’s, etc). | Bark barbecue omg | I've heard the ribs very rarely, I don't recall them being excellent. 

But Hometown is the only place other than Austin I've had a beef rib. 

Hometown is a very very solid approximation of Austin BBQ. 

BTW, their pastrami sandwich is KILLER!! Although not Texas BBQ. | What borough? You're getting recs from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. | What do you guys think of Mighty Quinn BBQ? | that would be hoodoo brown in ridgefield ct | Hometown is really the only place for brisket. Billy is the King.

Dinosaur BBQ is still doing a pretty great job. I really like their ribs and their wings.

Fette sau was good when it was busy. Without volume all BBQ doesn't hold up. The best joints in the country move serious amounts of meat. It's always fresh. And moving off the cue over time. Hometown is the only one currently busy enough to do fresh brisket. Pork holds up better. Mighty Quinn's can be good. But again, when it's not fresh (eg made within 2 hours) it's kind of meh. Never been to John Brown. But sounds like they have a volume problem now that it's less ""New."" 

why can't we just support people doing it right.?People are way too influenced by buzz. 

However, NYC was a BBQ wasteland pre 2000. So I'm just happy there's a few decent spots: fletchers was good too (RIP) | BBQ is not even in the top 20 cuisines you need to try in NYC. 

Get pastrami instead. It’s NY-style BBQ.  | Like going to Texas and asking
About bagels… | Here's a hack for what I thought was pretty good Texas BBQ, delivered to you in many Manhattan neighborhoods, for less than $1:

The food will come from Tejas Barbecue, a highly acclaimed joint originally established in Tomball, Texas.

[https://www.tejaschocolate.com/barbecue](https://www.tejaschocolate.com/barbecue)

They've franchised to a service called Wonder in New York, a sort of ghost kitchen in many of NY's best neighborhoods that features many celebrity chefs on their menu.

I have ordered their brisket for $17.50, but paid less than $5 because they were offering a $15 off each of two orders promotion. The brisket sandwich is $13.50, which would probably be free if you ordered for pickup.

Here is my referral code for that promotion. I get the same bonus when people use the code.

[https://www.wonder.com/order?auto\_applied\_promo\_code=ANDREW7254](https://www.wonder.com/order?auto_applied_promo_code=ANDREW7254)

It's a great way of getting two solid meals for nothing. I've been pleased with it, and I think others would be too. It's practically no-risk and the venture capitalists are paying for it. | Doesn’t have a brick and mortar location but Jase’s BBQ is 🔥🔥🔥 | There’s a nice classy joint called Dallas BBQ /s | Yeah BBQ here isn’t great. They also sell old and stale meats if you don’t come at the right time. In Texas they just run out. Don’t go to a random spot with ribs that claims its soul food, will also likely be bad. | Why are you looking for BBQ in NYC?

As well known as this city is for food, there are cuisines it's just not that great at or has extremely limited options. BBQ is high on that list. | I can attest the Dominican side of things is authentic. | They have a stand alone restaurant now right? Because I tried their brisket at Smorgaburg once and it was the worst i've ever had | I used to go to John Brown's a lot, but then went once last year and it was one of the worst meals I've ever had. Don't think i'll go back. It was straight garbage in the new location. | John Browns is the best IMO with Hometown a close second. I would put these 2 places up against places i have eaten down south. Almost every other place in NYC is a few steps behind these 2 places.

The brisket is better at Hometown and the ribs are better at John Browns. | Hill country sausages are good | It got really expensive but you could do worse. (might quinns lolol) | I like it. I’ve only had it at the Open, but it’s good. It’s not Texas Monthly level. But neither is Rudy’s and I ate there all the time in Texas. Also a nice change of pace from Pizza.  | Ireland 🇮🇪 😁 | Actually, even though I do love the brisket at Hometown, THIS right here is 100% the play. I only go to Hometown because I live here… If I didn’t live in NYC and was visiting for a brief window, I would get two pastramis over ever doing barbecue once. | [deleted] | Yeah, unless it absolutely has to be that, there's alternatives that are going to be better here than most of our BBQ. For the giant pieces of meat craving I'd go for some roast duck or char siu at Big Wong or Wu's (my favorite Cantonese roast duck in the city) that are tough to find other places. Or pernil and lechon. | Soooo expensive but it’s probably my favorite | Hometown is expensive, but nowhere close to the quality of the top tier/TX monthly ranked spots, like it's fine and the quality falls somewhere similar to Terry Black's or Rudy's 

Gotta reiterate it's not bad, but wouldn't call them immediate picks - these are places I'd recommend to someone if convenience is higher priority than taking the time/effort to hit up a top rated bbq place | They have a set up at Time Out Market in Dumbo | You have to remember BBQ like most meat centric food is always hit or miss. Sometimes you get the perfect fatty piece and other times you get the tougher end piece. Someone is getting the end piece. Sometimes it's a slow day and the BBQ Sits around for too long. At the price of meat it's not getting thrown out. I find with almost every BBQ or steakhouse for everytime I go and its amazing another time it's just OK. You should give it another try. | I was born in Texas and currently live in North Carolina, so I’ve been exposed to a lot of barbecue over the years. When I lived in LIC, I’d go to John Browns fairly often, mostly in the old location but a couple times in the new location. John Browns could sometimes be excellent, but it was the most inconsistent barbecue place I’ve ever been to. I went to Hometown only a couple of times, but I thought it was great and agree that it holds its own against even the best down South. | I went to Mighty Quinns recently because it was nearby and budget-friendly. Never again. The best way I can describe the brisket was that it was a meat puddle. It was way overcooked to the point it had no texture. Like, none. | Mighty Quinn’s is ballpark BBQ | Pastrami. Shuya Ramen. Fine dining. STEAK. Free hot dogs at Rudy's. | Bbq is pretty expensive all over. Go to just about any bbq place and it will be expensive. Urban bbq like nyc or famous ones like Green Street Meats on Chicago are all hipster priced, because that’s what the market will bear and their clientele. 

My response is that the bbq here is not special. You’re better off getting a different cuisine than mediocre bbq. | I'd argue that the lamb banh mi at Hometown is better than anything you can get at franklin's or cattleack's which are both ranked in the top 10 of TX bbq. (I actually think Cattleack is very overrated but still good, can't complain about good BBQ but I wouldn't rate it as highly.) Franklin's is special but it's so rich and buttery, and everything outside of the brisket is okay. (I preordered and bought the whole menu for a party)

I love BBQ, and am from TX. I've eaten a majority of the ones in austin and dallas/ft. worth. They're very very good, but they often times have long lines, aren't cheap, and are exceptionally fatty/succulent.


Your experience at hometown will be expensive, but checks enough of the boxes. They also do a good job smoking the chicken which a lot of TX places neglect.

I will say, I don't rate places based on sides, because I nibble at them while I gorge on meat. | This is an important point. 

IME, hometown bbq has the most consistent brisket and beef rib. 

Consistency is key for bbq joints in the city imo, even dinosaur bbq can have a great day. | This guys right, John Brown generally sucks ass. However, the burnt ends and cornbread are some kind of freakish anomaly because they're possibly the two best BBQ items in NYC. Everything else there though is just awful. | I'm from KC. Even the best spots can be a touch inconsistent. Nature of the feast | hm ok- thanks for the insight. maybe I will! | [deleted] | yeah don't buy 14$ bland and subpar gyros people for fucks sake | also, anecdotally I worked in Detroit's ""best"" BBQ place. It was also pretty expensive. I never liked brisket. Until I went to texas and had BBQ there and it just blew my fucking mind and at the same price."
Best soup when sick with a sore throat,"Hi all, I've caught a bug and am dealing with a sore throat and looking for a soup that won't aggravate it. Yesterday I ordered a beef noodle soup from a hand pulled noodle place, but the noodles made my phlegm worse and the oily broth made me nauseous.

Any suggestions for a light broth that isn't oily and super salty? I'm not sure if pho or some chicken noodle soup would be light enough. I was also eyeing Okdongsik's pork broth soup","Okdongsik is great. 

I would also do pho such as chicken pho from Pho Ga Vang.

Tosokchon also has great light soups like their samgyetang.

Also depends if you’re ordering delivery for what’s available to you. | Greek avgolemono is solid for sick | Brodo | I love the Tom Yum at Yum Yum Too"
Is Maison Close worth it?,"Can someone tell me if the 10pm reservation is worth the $250 min per person over the 8pm reservation with no min? I assume my group can be seated at the bar for the night show, it just doesn’t include the entertainment during the dinner? This is for a birthday celebration but the minimum price and bar seating over having a table is stumping me. Can someone tell me if the 10pm reservation is really worth it?","If you plan on staying there after dinner to party then yes that makes it’s worth it. At a certain point (I think it was around 11:30) the restaurant fully transforms into like a bottle service club atmosphere. 
I’m not sure if they have performers for both dinner seatings but the performers for the later seating come around to your tables and interact with the group which is fun."
One Day NYC Food Tour,"My son just came up with this idea where we go to the best restaurants in the city one day for all meals.  Best breakfast spot, lunch, dinner, dessert.

We are definitely going to do this, but search engines are terrible for curating such a trip.

Are there ‘British Chinese’ restaurants in Manhattan?,"Social media posts of British Chinese food (e.g. munch boxes, chicken balls, pawn crackers, etc.) have bothered me so much that I’ve developed a curiosity to try. Are there any establishments in Manhattan where I can get myself an order of something similar?","The closest thing I've read about is Irish Chinese food at The Kitchen Bronx. Here is a link to the restaurant,  [https://thekitchenbronx.com/gallery](https://thekitchenbronx.com/gallery)  and the menu where you have to scroll down to see the Chinese food [https://order.chownow.com/order/15216/locations/21497?cn\_script=true](https://order.chownow.com/order/15216/locations/21497?cn_script=true) | Not that I’ve seen. Munch box and spice boxes are Scottish (British) and Irish (not British) respectively and not prevalent across Britain. There isn’t a homogeneous British Chinese food really, though things like prawn toast and chicken balls are common. Liverpool for example has its own Chinese food culture. | Lol absolutely not | Prawn crackers are just your garden variety shrimp chip. You can get the cute rainbow bags at 99 Ranch or H Mart. I saw someone on reddit recommend Chiu Hong for fresh shrimp chips but can't verify myself.


edit: meant to say prawn crackers are not British, just the name is | You want that? My worst Chinese restaurant experiences were in the UK and Ireland. | I’m wondering if it’s worth me (British guy in the UK) ordering whatever you want from a decent Chinese takeaway near me, freezing it, packaging it thoroughly with ice blocks/packs and sending it to the US of A. Next day delivery is possible. In return you could send me some great food from NYC! | You gotta go to the Australian Chinese restaurants. There's a risk of getting arrested though. | Thankfully, no. | can someone just tell me where to get CRISPY shredded beef? It was the biggest disappointment to me as a British expat ordering “shredded beef” from a Chinese here and getting stir fried beef… 

I’ve yet to find a Chinese that does it.

(In Clinton Hill but willing to travel, far).

EDIT: thank you for all the recommendations so far! Looks like I have some eatin’ to do. | can anyone help find NYC Chinese in Berlin? | [deleted] | Do you love a curry on a Saturday night? Go try the Irish-Chinese spice bag at Feile on 33rd, great beers as well. | Brit Living in NYC - only one I’ve encountered in my decade here was the prawn cracker. It was called “Shrimp Chips” on the menu. | I'd love British Indian.  I think NYC Indian food is kinda crap, it's all the same, greasy, over sauced stuff. | Shrimp crackers are on the sidedish at many Indonesian restaurant in Queens. | BOSHHHHHHH | Huh, I'd be curious about this.  You can find Latin Chinese and Indo Chinese without too much difficulty though. | Wait there’s no prawn crackers here? | [deleted] | What the fuck is “Brit Chinese” food? Keep that shit over there | It's a good restaurant too. Not a sit down place though. They do have spice bags and stuff. Good fries and burgers. | Looks like a refined menu! I’m intrigued. Thank you for suggesting! | This place is SO good, it’s in my neighborhood and  dangerously easy to stop in 😄 if you’re not close by I’d say it’s worth a trip up here | What are prawn crackers in this context? Shrimp toast or just shrimp chips (the pastel-colored fried rice paper w/ maybe some shrimp flavor)?

Both of those are certainly available here.  Though I'll admit, I don't remember the last time I saw shrimp toast, probably at King Yum (rip) on the pu pu plater... | Thank you for the cultural lessons! I will now be going down the rabbit hole that is Liverpool Chinese food culture | This is the only right answer. 

My morbid curiosity also got the best of me and now I’m on the British Chinese TikTok algorithm and it’s simultaneously fascinating and horrifying all at the same time. The bland curry sauce looks almost glue like and the way they get so enthusiastic about soggy fries should be criminal. | There's novelty in getting a giant box of food. Koronet wouldn't have multiple locations if there wasn't | On the flip side, I took Irish family to Hwa Yuan in Chinatown and they were freaked. Hadn’t realized how different Irish Chinese food was… | I’m here for all spices of life!!! | Please tell me more!! I’m about to look into Aussie Chinese food. I’d imagine it to be better than UK Chinese food since I know there’s much more of a prevalent Chinese immigrant population there? | My go to dish at Amaze on 3rd between 43 and 44. | How’s the sauce supposed to be? Joe’s Shanghai has Sesame Beef and Orange Beef. Basically battered and deep fried strips of beef with your typical sweet sesame sauce or sweet orange sauce. | It’s my partner’s favorite dish so we’ve sampled many places. The top two are Nomad Tea Parlor in flatiron and Chi in midtown west. Both have crunchy coating and great sauces. | Phillipe Chow has it on their menu. I think both upper East side and meatpacking locations. | Crispy Spicy Shredded Beef at SpyC in Forest Hills. | Hwa yuan Szechuan has fantastic crispy beef, absolutely have to try it. Their cold sesame noodles are also awesome | Red Bowl is Bay Ridge has a crispy beef dish | If you want beef crispy, the best thing to do is get orange or tangerine chicken if you see it on a menu. | Late to this but I believe what you’re looking for is at a Shanghainese restaurant. Joe’s Shanghai should have it. | There was a ghost kitchen in LIC that had pretty good jjajangmyun, but I forget the name and I’m not sure if they’re still around. Also, I’m surprised to hear that. I thought jjajangmyun was pretty common in Korean restaurants, though I don’t think I’ve ever had Korean food in Brooklyn. | Which neighborhoods have you looked so far? Some Brooklyn options:

-	Kuun
-	Ejen
-	Woori | I Brick Lane in Manhattan/JC block off the PATH does British Curry House style. I thought they got a Michelin Bib Gourmand, but couldn't find in a quick look so maybe my memory is foggy. | What’s British Indian? | nandos was legit though | What? | We would call them “shrimp chips” and for whatever reason, they’re more served with Thai food in the US than with Chinese food. | You can buy duros / raw prawn crackers on the LES to make at home | Prawn crackers are just white vaguely prawn flavored chips | You’ll find in different parts of the U.K. chip shops will also serve the food of the owners. So in Liverpool all chippys pretty much are Chinese and serve both traditional fish and chips based stuff and Chinese food and people often mix and match. In North London a lot chippys are Greek Cypriot owned and do a combo of Greek Cypriot food and fish and chips. | Hahaha you may come across sarcastic comments from me in the comments. 

The food just looks depressing — it’s all fried, brown. And so disproportionately doused in sauce…

But this is why I want to try it; so I can truly say I knocked it after trying it | Try it, then you can trash it. | its pretty much the greatest drunk food ever.  I knew I was in for a good time when the grease was soaking through the pizza box they arrived in (last time I was in northern England) | Boggled Munch box, etc. okay fried goodies are always a hit. Just remember ordering takeout in Ireland, got a dish full of peanuts where no peanuts were warranted, later went to the ""best"" Chinese restaurant in London, asked for Chicken with vegetables, got boiled chicken in gravy on a cabbage leaf. | Can't think of any names but you're guaranteed a succulent Chinese meal! | Best sesame chicken in New York hands down is at JS | Dude SpyC is so freaking good! God I miss living in Queens. | [deleted] | Everytime I've gone to the UK, the Indian food there is incredible and so much better than the typical stuff here.  There are plenty of similar dishes, but the curry there is just on another level.

And Dishoom makes a lot of American Indian food downright second-rate. | Prawn crackers used to come in a jumble of pastel colors when I was a kid. They would pile them up around certain dishes at all the nice banquet-type Chinese restaurants here in NY and my cousins and I loved chomping on them. | You ever had French fries with ketchup and plum bbq sauce? Forget the chop cheese if you wanna talk about a new york classic | Id rather have good food when I'm drunk | Sounds like you went to another region, with a different set of dishes and cultural influences on a fusion food, and ordered what you'd order in the US. 

  
British cuisine is absolutely horrible, but this is not how I would have approached this order. | Enjoy! Fully understand the jjajangmyun cravings. Queens still has the best but convenience gets points too. | Oh wow. I wonder if there’s some connection between UK and India that makes Indian food so much better there. | [deleted] | is this sarcasm | Oh yea soondae is another hard one to find. No problem! | Yes because there’s no actual cuisine called “British Indian”. Indian food is just better in Britain for those reasons."
Favorite egg bagels,"I am in the throes of an egg bagel addiction. My recent favorite is Pick A Bagel's (8th ave location. It doesn't look like their other locations are as good.). Their egg bagel is SO soft and fluffy. I just had their best one yet on Sunday because it was freshly made and lightly baked -- in a good, not overbaked way.

Which places have your favorite egg bagels? Can be any borough. I am thinking Thompkins Square is my next stop.

UPDATE: went to Thompkins Square and it usurped Pick A Bagel. Got an egg and cheese egg bagel. Crisp outside and very soft and fluffy on the inside. Great flavor. 

UPDATE 2: went to Broad Nosh for an egg and cheese egg bagel. Not my favorite egg bagel. Too crispy for me and not as flavorful or sweet as Thompkins. Though you can tell it's a high quality bagel. Just didn't fit my preferences. Great blueberry and French toast bagels -- you could eat them by themselves! 

UPDATE 3: went to Bagel Pub. Great egg bagel! Soft, fluffy, and a bit crisp on the outside. Good flavor. 

","Absolute | Had a good one at Bagel Pub in park slope a little while back! | Broad nosh, at least on the UWS - I haven't tried their other locations.  Their egg bagel is on par with their superb french toast bagel (which I think might be their egg bagel underneath anyway!)

  
Liberty's egg bagel is decent too. | Def Tompkins sq | Bk bagel in chelsea is pretty soft n fluffy | I love the egg bagels at Brooklyn Bagel (the location near W. Sq. Park, E. 8th st) | Bagel oasis or utopia bagels in queens are always solid.  | Bagels and Co on the UWS | Egg or egg everything from Terrace Bagels in Windsor Terrace | NY Jumbo Bagel on 56th and 2nd Ave | Thank you! Never had their egg bagel before!  | This is the answer. | Thank you! I got an everything bagel last time I was there and was not impressed. I’ll give their egg bagels a try!  | Thanks! I’ve heard of utopia. Adding these spots to my list.  | No problem! Personally no better bagel exists unless you’re willing to go to Bagel Boy or Utopia. 

But I’m biased and grew up in Brooklyn. | Their egg bagels are on the sweeter side but it’s really good | they have egg everything bagels that I think are delicious, might be worth a shot"
"Something to bring to Thanksgiving, suggestions?","In previous years, I've picked up dessert at Super Moon and Dominique Ansel to bring to my uncle's place in long island. Want to bring something different this year, any suggestions?

Edit: any appetizer/finger food suggestions instead of dessert?

Edit2: Thanks all the suggestions. Going to check out Michaeli Bakery and grab a bunch of pastries from there.","Pie from four and twenty blackbirds (salty honey is my fave), chocolate babka from breads bakery, lady m cakes, magnolia bakery banana pudding | Recently had the borek at Michaeli Bakery, and it was great. They were smaller than normal, so a little larger than hors d'ouvres size. | Spanish tinned fish with crackers? | Cookie plate from Veniero’s | Dinner rolls. Fresh dinner rolls. Enough so the hosts can make small turkey sandwiches with them the next day, so ... many dozens. | Cheese, bread and little snacks from Eataly. Cute (and delicious) pastries from Bibble and Sip. | Bring a turkey in case the other is dry. | If not dessert, then:

- Dumplings (North Dumpling, King Dumpling, etc)
- Lumpia shanghai (Ihawan, Renee's)
- Pork buns (Mei Lai Wah, Golden Steamer)
- Savory pies (Kora)
- Empanadas (Mama's Empanadas)
- Tamales (Evelias Tamales)
- Kimbap (Little Banchan Shop, Woorijip, Kimganae)
- Spanakopita (Omonia Cafe) | Redgate Bakery and Pastry Box both have fantastic pumpkin loaves   

Rigor Hills Sourdough and a spread from their offer  

Or go to Marlow and Daughters (She wolf bakeries but her shop) and get some loaves and ask for appetisers that travel well | Peete’s Pies. Best pie in the city. | good charcuterie plate. milk bar has an amazing pumpkin pie. | Never heard of four and twenty blackbirds. Looks good | Thanks for the recommendation.

After Matinee Restaurants Recommendations ,"Going to see The Outsiders matinee w my family who all appreciate good food and nice dinners. We're from NJ and it's rare that we all go together to NYC. It's my husband's bday so I'd like to go somewhere nicer but not that nice.  He doesn't like fussy.  I'd like to go to one of the more known ""must go to""  restaurants but also not necessary.  We're open to leaving the theater district.  Please help me with some suggestions!!  ","We need a little more info to give you the best possible recs I think 😊 

What type of cuisines do yall all like? Any allergies or budget constraints? And how large a group? | Ci Siamo is pretty close | Gramercy Tavern. | Le Rock…
Modern Bar (at MoMA)…
Bad Roman…
Grand Central Oyster Bar…
Avra on Madison …
Monkey Bar… | Well, we're all pretty different as far cuisine likes and dislikes so I'd say French, Italian, American are all pretty safe.  Budget, I would say mid high end. When I suggested Le Bernadin, it was balked at...so maybe a tier or two less than that category | Orso and Joe Allen are the classic pre- or post-theater upscale restaurants. You may even spot some actors. Marseille (suggested already) is also similar in vibe. If you're up for Thai and want a hipper ambience, I was really impressed with the food at Chalong. | Bond 45 | Red Eye Grill | [deleted] | Back to give some recs, thanks for the added color! 

I’d say Bryant Park Grill is pretty solid for American cuisine and the holiday market is open now too. Chez Josephine or Marseille if you’re leaning French. Felice 56 for Italian. 

A bit further but Zaytinya and Zou Zous might have the right ambiance as well if you’re open to Mediterranean! | Dude I’m asking so I can give them recs tailored to their group? Obviously people can give them broad recs w the info they gave but since it’s a birthday and it’s rare for them to all come into the city together like this, I’d like to give them recs that are as helpful as possible. 

Nothing is weird about what I asked. People might have picky teens or parents who don’t like X cuisine and forget to mention. A group of 4 will be able to get a table somewhere popular more easily than a group of 10. And so on. 

I didn’t ask rudely or condescendingly, sorry if you’re being triggered but that’s something you gotta take up with your therapist, not me | Marseille is nearby and has a big airy room good for groups. "
Best wings for take-out in the East Village?,Have been craving wings and my two usual spots have since closed down.  Any you recommend in the east village?,"Hairy Lemon, not sure they are on the apps probably have to call in and do takeout. | The onion tree pizza company has DELICIOUS chicken wings that come in a chilli tamarind sauce. The portion size is also great. | Dry pepper wings from Han Dynasty! | Phoebes is excellent for takeout, good price, and you can do dry rub with sauce on the side | The Grafton, Fish Cheeks | - Don Chicken
- Sao Mai
- Crown Fried Chicken | Marinara Pizza has very solid buffalo wings | Dan and johns | Def gotta go in | Good to know! Thanks | Thanks will try them next 🙏🏾 | Awesome thanks. Will try Don Chicken | EV location closed sir | No problem. Enjoy! | Were pretty mediocre anyway | Yup crazy overpriced and not that great.  I pass their chelsea location all the time but no desire to pay $$$ for wings"
Suggestion for a Modern Asian vibe?,"I'm going to NYC with my girlfriend for the first time, and I want to take her to a special restaurant. Last year, we went to Buenos Aires and dined at a restaurant called Nino Gordo (Ig: xniniogordox) a trendy, relaxed spot with a modern Asian vibe. We tried the Katsu Sando there, and it was simply incredible! Since then, she keeps reminding me how much she wants to have it again. So, I'd love to surprise her with a restaurant of a similar style in NYC, ideally one that also serves Katsu Sando. Any recommendations?

Pics from Nino Gordo BA",Bar moga
Walk into Parm on a Monday night? Or good alternatives?,"I want to meet a friend at Parm on Mulberry on an upcoming Monday night. For some context, I have an event until 6:30pm around Union Square. Would it be too hard to get a table at around 7pm on a Monday? Or would it be like an hour+ wait?

If you think this is a bad idea, any alternative suggestions? I know that Parm is delish, the price point is great, and it’s close enough to the 6 train so it’s convenient to get to. Thanks!","If you're in Union Square id recommend Joe and Pats. They take reservations and always have one, and you can almost always walk in. Their pizzas are awesome, their red sauce Italian stuff hits the spot. 

Parm delivers almost everywhere in the city and I think their food lends itself to take out. Joe and Pats pizza only hits if you get it fresh on metal pan, but buy does it hit. 

If you do go - penne Alla vodka with a chicken cutlet added and the fried calamari with buffalo sauce on the side both are amazing."
Anywhere I can get a “Colony Grill” pizza?,As in a bar pizza with hot oil and preferably serranos on top. I’m craving one. Without going to Stamford. ,"Their location in Port Chester is the only other option. Everything else is a disappointment. | I grew up in Fairfield county and have been going to Colony my entire life. I lived in NYC for over 10 years and searched endlessly for something remotely similar, and haven’t come up with much.

BUT, emmets on grove does make a very good bar pie - it’s just different. | The Beekman Ale House in Sleepy Hollow has a hot oil pizza. All their pizzas are bar type and exceptionally good. Good drinks too. | hope you find an answer here. | Riko’s in Merrick has the same style pizza. Pretty sure the owner used to work for Colony. | If you find yourself on Long Island, Riko’s (Merrick and Levittown) make this and it’s delicious | Yeah I am also a proud son of the nutmeg and I haven’t found anything here close to our style of pizza. | Emmett's on Grove is close but not the same | Guess there’s an opportunity to say the least. I grew up on colony too | I lived in CT for nine years and had a fair amount of Colony Grill during that time, the hot oil and stingers were requirements for my pies.  I'm in the WV now so thank for the tip about Emmett's!  Won't go there expecting Colony Grill's stuff though ;) | Might as well drive to the original Colony Grill in Stamford at that point, pretty much the same amount of traveling time. I wish we had a place in the city that makes the same style of pizza, unfortunately I haven’t found one as of yet. Regardless, I appreciate the rec, will definitely check it out if ever nearby. | Lol yeah people only naming places in Long Island or westchester is tragic. At that point I’ll just go to stamford | Seems so :( Hey any restaurateurs reading this thread, I sense an untapped market!"
Where can I get a runza in NYC?,"Inspired by this article. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/us/elections/nebraska-runza-tim-walz.html

Now I want to try one, but I have no idea where to look. I am resigned to the fact this may not exist in NYC. ","Years ago , I dated a woman from Nebraska. Tried to find this too as a surprise to no avail, just ended up mail ordering them (was not as pricey as it is now) She loved them,  I thought they were ok,  tasted like a cross between a soft hot pocket and a white castle cheeseburger.  To each it's own I guess. So yeah, maybe like a chopped cheese (which did not ""exist"" then) | You can’t. I think the only other place they’ve opened outside of Nebraska is Fort Collins, Colorado 

Im from Nebraska. Not the most amazing food in the world but you better believe I eat one everyday when I visit. I make them occasionally but it’s not the same. 

Also their fries, onion rings, and chili are really good. | Think it's easier to make one than buy one around here.

Very confusing food. | I dunno if I want one bad enough to order them. But maybe. I have a feeling they won't be worth it | There is one in Lawrence, KS. I believe another in the north east of KS as well. There’s also a few in Iowa. | Agreed - I make them every so often. I freeze the leftovers and pop one in the microwave when I get the hankering. | I would fuck with a cheese frenchee. | Sorta. The original is a small soft bread loaf stuffed with seasoned ground beef and cabbage | Probably. Or hot pocket type thing | The won’t be. | Wow! They’re starting to spread! Love that | The Lawrence location is several decades old. I think it’s been on Iowa St there, just south of KU’s campus since the mid 80s. | Huh never knew that"
Best place to buy brisket to cook at home? ,Preferably on the west side ,"Was going to say Costco or western beef, but those are not in the city. Instacart? | Lobel’s maybe great but the prices there…sheesh. That being said, I’ve had the most amazing steaks outside of Wolfgang’s there. 

I like Schatzie’s on the UWS. Broadway and 101. Good stuff. | Pomegranate in Brooklyn is a kosher market but has some very nice cuts | Costco or Costco business center in Bayonne. | What’s on sale it’s brisket | I always get it at Whole Foods, and it comes out great. | If you really want THE BEST, Loebel’s.

Sometimes it won’t be out but they’ll usually pull it for you if you ask. | Ooh you think the east side Costco has it?

Restaurant recs for company holiday party near Union Square,"I'm in charge of planning holiday parties for my company, and we have a hub office in Union Square so I'm remotely coordinating for them! The party will be max 18 people, and we have at least one person that doesn't do dairy so a place that only serves cream pasta would probably be a no-go. I'd like to send them somewhere pretty decently nice to make it equitable between our other offices, but I have intel that our CEO would prefer Chinese food and karaoke so I'm open to suggestions for both of those categories. Aiming for around $150 per person with food + beverage! I have only been to NYC a couple times so I would appreciate any recommendations people can give. Thanks in advance!! ","Don Angie in the west village for great Italian food (they have a  private room that seats 18), keen’s steakhouse (but it’s in midtown), Il Buco, Wu’s wonton king is an amazing spot in Chinatown but much more casual/BYOB, then head to karaoke at Winnie’s Bar after"

Any suggestions on where can I find authentic Pan de Muerto? Preferably in Queens or Manhattan somewhere?

And then a person using a fork and knife on their pizza?  WTF? | Honestly, the takeaway should be that pizza is better than it's ever been.  My newish neighborhood pizza spot would be destination pizza just 10 years ago  (Norms).

We lost Dom, and I think Di Fara's was the perfect NY slice.  But there are so many shops that have elevated beyond generic NYC slice. | Here -  I put them all on a map so they are easier to find;

just call it a “hot” list or something like that. | Gift link: [https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html?unlocked\_article\_code=1.V04.v6aK.YINaznMyH3lR&smid=url-share](https://www.nytimes.com/article/best-nyc-pizza-pizzeria.html?unlocked_article_code=1.V04.v6aK.YINaznMyH3lR&smid=url-share) | Mama’s Too erasure | Upside Pizza is not a top or best pizza. I am surprised its on the list. | Good to see L&B still getting the respect it deserves in this hyper competitive market full of Instagram hot spots that are style over substance. | Best Pizza not on this list is criminal | Where is Mano’s?? | No John’s of Bleecker or Lucali's? Huh | For L&B they show a triangle slice?!? Blasphemy! | can’t believe Rocco’s of Bed-Stuy is on here — not even close to the a top slice in the neighborhood, much less the city. | Sad to not see anything in uptown manhattan on the list. | Surprised to see no New Park (Howard Beach). 

Really happy to see milkflower on there. Have been enjoying their pizza for a very long time. Dani’s is nice to see, I think giving someone both a regular slice due to the sweet sauce and a pesto slice is a transcendent experience. 

I think Bleecker St Pizza always gets snubbed. 

Man I have eaten a lot of fucking pizza in this city. | mano’s erasure will not be tolerated. | Angelo’s !!    Not a credible list | Lees taven on Staten Island is a must | Suprema should be on here | Missing Philomenas in Sunnyside is a ridiculous mistake | No overall thoughts on the list but does exclude what I think is my current new fav Fini Pizza | I grew up in Flushing and can personally attest to the greatness of Lucia’s. | No Philomena’s is wild. | Where the hell is Tony’s pizza? I love Tony’s. | Upside? Meh

No keste? | This has Roberta’s which is below mid now. 

It’s also missing Aces.

I don’t trust this list | Weird that so many of the photographs are gross - lemon wedges on a pizza, whole slices of ham, some idiot eating with a knife and fork, etc. | where is mama toos. is this a joke

Also 99 cent fresh pizza.

these two are top tier. | Weird that una got placed #1 pizzeria in the world and doesn’t even get rated | Ops not being on this list is wild! But also these sorts of lists are cursed endeavors so 🤷🏾‍♂️ | No Lucali or Mama's Too is CRAZY. I stopped reading these articles a long time ago anyway. 8it app aggregates all the top dishes from all these lists so you can just see them in a map view. There's too many lists & ""best of"" videos to keep up with its exhausting... | whoever made this list needs to be jailed | Where the hell is Rubirosa? This list is definitely incomplete.
Emilio’s of Morris Park is the worst pizza ever. If you want good pizza in the Bronx you have to go to Louie & Ernie’s or Tommy’s | No Luigi’s is criminal | Joe's listed, opinion automatically disregarded | article is paywalled :( | kind of shocked that una pizza napoletana wasn't on their list. it's not on mine, but i thought i was in the minority | L'Industrie, hands down. | Obvs missing Mamas Too which is I believe the only slice place with a * from the times. Although they got rid of the spinach - their best pizza. And the attitude is enough to keep me as a once in a while customer. Also Sottocasa is the #1 pizza place on TripAdvisor and quite good. | I can’t trust a pizza article written by someone who’s not a born & bred New Yorker | [deleted] | I’ve had Roberta’s a couple of times and it’s just terrible. I’ll never understand why it’s a staple on these lists. | Delmar is the most underrated pizzeria because it’s off the beaten path and never gets included in these lists. | A spot that a lot of people are sleeping on is Jonny’s in LES. It’s fairly new. Zooming out, it’s truly nuts how much good pizza we have here in this city. | I thought L and B was very mid pizza when I went. I didn’t get the hype at all. What am I missing (serious question)? | Lucia Pizza in Flushing? Top pizzeria in NYC? Nah. It's OK but top 25? Nahh. If that's top 25 then put in Lo Duca in Ditmas Park/Flatbush. Same ""type"" of pizza and way better. I find Lucia to be too salty. I always find that NY Times always tries to find some out of the way, non conventional location to find X food just so they can be inclusive or be different than other top food lists by other publications or reviewers. | I'll stick to my local joints in south Brooklyn | I’m totally fine with this list, none of my regular places were burned. | It's a decent list, but I think wizard hat was robbed tbh | I may be really basic but all I want is a decent dine in pizza place where they have a really good line management system (if you can’t book) and the wait is less than 40 mins. And the pizza is puffy and tasty and you can get a good glass of red. So in the 3 years I have lived here, that is Milkflower and Roberto’s. We’ve recently moved to the East village and I am so depressed. | Best and wheated not being on here is outrageous | New park isn’t on the list. Invalid. | No Luigi’s in Brooklyn. No Tommy’s in the Bronx. Sus | Rosa's
Brother's
Amore | Paulie gee Alice isn't that great | No Luigi’s? NYT proving time and time again they don’t know shit about shit. | Ungaro's my local spot and I 1000% suggest everyone take the trek to Staten Island for it | I am devastated that they exposed Rocco Pizza in Bed Stuy to a larger audience. Good for them though, well deserved- consistently great pizza | Hate to say it, I loved the man, but I've had some bad experiences with Andrew Belluci pizzeria since he passed | Not putting Wheated on Church Ave in the mix is a crime. | I haven't been, but where is Una Pizza Napoletana - I always see it as a top spot. | I don't see Ops in Bushwick, so this list is becoming even more sus | Joes is FUCKING TRASH and I’m exhausted at people seemingly not getting that. The most bland, uninteresting, flavorless garbage. It’s like if AI generated a pizza. They’re are a ton of places I’m surprised weren’t on here (Johnnys, Fini, Rubirosa, Best Pizza) but the fact they put Joes on is easily the most egregious thing about this. | Good my fave isn’t on here. Less tourists. | No Albas pizza from queens Blvd?? Sacrilege. | I just moved to Manhattan but still go to Queens for Dani's Pizza | Leaving off Una just feels contrarian. Not the worst I've seen though. | More like list of expensive pies. | Glad they left our Lucia Pizza of SoHo. Taste is bland and the crisp is so inconsistent. | Dani's House of Pizza is in my neighborhood, and it should not be on this list. It is a 7 or 8 out of 10. Good pizza, but nothing special. | Ok so it’s official. NYT Food section traffics in rage bait media lol | Who’s the farmer that compiled this list? The boys at Lazzara’s would like a word | Dani’s House of Pizza??? I’ve been there and it’s so mid. The fact that it’s included makes me question the validity of the entire list | Paulie Gee's slice shop no longer belongs on this list. There has been a drastic drop in quality over the last few months, if I'm in the area I go to Best. | lmao this list is a joke | don't get people's fascination with Joe's. it's not good. 

no prince street is criminal. however good on NYT for giving Dani's the love it deserves | I think that qualifies as a list of places to get pizza in NY. That’s about it. | I am relieved Mama's Toos is not on the list after this discussion https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1g8vcwt/what_places_are_overhyped_but_actually_deserve_it/lt1dj5t/ | I would have put prince street pizza on this list | Just tried Jonny's Pizza in LES last Saturday night. Their vodka pizza and vodka pepperoni slices were so good. One to watch! | Not even a PS for Prince St pepperoni. Bastards | John’s on Bleecker not making the top 25 is highly suspect

Edit: Upside and Paulie Gee’s, which are both fine, but over John’s? Who tf made this list 😂 | (This is in alphabetical order, as it is in the article) | You missed the first one on the list, Andrew Bellucci’s Pizza | Scarrs has been bad the last few times I went | I've become a hermit since having a baby, so I can only really comment on the Astoria joints, but... Milkflower and Belucci's are top 25? Really? | Damn bruh. Fancy seeing a fellow r/gonets bruh in the wild. | Honestly surprised Fini didn’t make the list, love their slices. | You’re missing the first one: Andrew Bellucci | Thank you! | Missed Rocco Pizza of Bedstuy | Justice for New Park Pizza | I’m going to be in NYC for 2 days which is a must try?? | Emilio's is really good, but Original Joe's up the block remains my go-to. Fantastic pizza, super nice folks, good crowd. There's just something right about that place. | My friends teases me that i’m a basic girly but L’industrie is so good though. | Dani’s pesto slice is good but that sweet sauce is disgusting | The pizza looks good but the IG hype is overkill. | Chrissys has been around for years, he just finally has a permanent spot | Everyone told me it’s a really good slice. The hype is overblown but apparently it’s still pretty good.  Looking forward to finally trying it. I wasn’t dealing with the reservation situation before | These people love a good gimmick to seem like they got some upper echelon taste bud. 

It looks delicious, but I ain’t going thru that hassle.

Number two reason why I don’t go to Lucali’s. I get it, but brother it’s 2024. | They probably gave up trying to get in.  Their line situation is just ridiculous.  I'm not even convinced there's a real pizza place in there. | No Suprema either is surprising to me at least | In the comments, one of the article authors said that she went to Lucali and thought the pizza was good but decided not to list because it was not good enough to overcome the lines,hassles, etc that come with it. | That fact alone is disqualifying | Lucali is super played out now with the lines and all. Five years ago it was good. Catch me at F and F. | Also no Una Pizza Napoletana | It’s impossible to get in anyways | Lucali is the most overrated pizza on the planet, and the staff are complete assholes. Glad they're not on the list, not that they need it. | Maybe de Blasio is trying for a comeback and his first move was to make this list | Ghost written by DeBlasio | Agreed. I think the only interesting thing about this list is the amount of outer borough love. The rest is just a snooze. Good pizza abounds in NYC now. For the NYT to be showcasing New York's ""best"" bagels and pizza is just boring. I'd love to see a list of the 25 most interesting Chinese dishes, or Mexican restaurants etc. Show me something new, paper of record. | Great comment.   With social media / YouTube it has gotten pretty easy to ""clone"" your favorite dough and sauce.   


And the accessibility to great ovens has also helped.  Look at L'Industrie who I think is the best slice shop, they use an ELECTRIC deck oven.  No fancy brick, coal, gas, wood fired oven.   There are some breweries by me in Florida that push out great Neapolitan style pies out of a bench top oven. | Norm’s in downtown Brooklyn? Is it worth trying out? | LOVE norms especially their vodka slice | Pizza at a slice shop is better than it’s ever been. Sit down pizza spots are in shambles though outside of Rubirosa. Losing Otto’s, Marta and Pulino’s all in a row really hurt things imo re: actually interesting and innovative sit down pizza spots. | Rip Dominick. 
So happy I lived down the block for years. Had it almost everyday, still do. 
And it STILL holds up currently, while not the absolute perfection it was. It’s Amazing. 

The ingredients are all the same, the ovens are the same, his kids still follow the same recipe.
It should make any city top 25 list. | You have the wrong location for L&B. The Dumbo one on Google maps has not opened yet / does not exist yet- the only one open is out in bensonhurst. 

Ps already been said, but if you go there get the grandma pie | i saw the post title and instantly got excited for the drama

fight fight fight | I won’t respect a list without mamas too | Nah I can never understand how Mama's Too has so much hype and the experience is godawful at both locations

No pizza is worth suffering through a shitshow line then you get to deal with extremely rude and incompetent staff | the one in soho is excellent the others are mid. not sure why. | I fucking love Best Pizza. | Yeah for sure. Rocco is totally fine pizza but I would never put it on any list. | Rocco’s is the “hey the pizza at this kids birthday party is not half bad” spot | Agreed! I used to live near Rocco's and it was my ""nothing else is open"" dinner option. Very mid pizza. Kinda discredits the whole list. | NYT too scared to go above Times Square 😭 | I just recently tried Bleecker Street Pizza for the first time and it immediately became my favorite in the city. The chipotle chicken slice changed my life. | now that’s a pizza pizza | went last night, oily as hell. Should have just gone to Joe’s. 10 bucks for 2 cheese slices | I agree Fini has good pizza but the owner is everything i dislike about the modern NYC dining scene and Williamsburg in particular. He's the classic Wall Street bro turned restaurateur.

In April 2020, he had the nerve to ask the public to contribute to the fund for the workers of Lilia and Misi. Restaurants that had been filled to capacity for years leading up to covid. Like, maybe the extremely rich owner of these restaurants should foot the bill for his employees, not the public?

This also gave me pretty [reptilian vibes.](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/05/sean-feeney-trump-restaurants-roundtable)

I know this sounds a little soapboxy, but i just can't shake the feeling that Feeney is a poster child for those who look at a neighborhood with character (or former character) and see nothing but dollar signs. | First time I had Fini it was amazing, but the last few times it's been average. | That grandma slice with the smoked mozz is phenomenal | Yeah, but Amore should be on here and Brother's too. | Quiet now, this is one that Sunnyside needs to gatekeep… | I commented the same thing!!! | Well Denino's and Joe & Pat's are on the list for Staten Island style pies, and they're both better than Rubirosa for pizza, but Rubirosa has them both beat in non pizza entrees, appetizers, drinks, atmosphere, and pretty much everything else outside of pizza. | John and Joes on Lydig and Louie and Ernie’s are the quintessential Bronx spots. | Luigi's is a terrific neighborhood slice but I'm okay with it not being on a top 10 or top 25 list. 

I'm not even throwing shade at Luigi's, I think it goes to show how spoiled we are with so many great pizza shops in NYC more than anything. | Gift Link's been posted in the thread now | Pretty sure it’s not paywalled, it was not for me at least | Ace's | lions & tigers & squares on 23rd and 8th is my favorite. | Nate's | Bushwick or Williamsburg? Their Moore st location always hits | The rooftop location by Penn Station is a great place to drink wine with out of towners. | Yeah their quality has gone down a lot. 

On the other hand Paulie Gees >>>> Paulie G slice shop | OG location is still amazing. And the R. Slice shop next door is also great. | Lo duca is missing and I don’t understand | I disagree. I hate going to bk cuz of how far I live. If any of my people would wanna go there for Paulie G’s I’m in there. | Prince street is trash these days | Joe's is a great classic NY slice, but if you prefer new school artisan slices I can see why it wouldn't be your thing | The only PS Prince Street pizza needs is a reminder that the owners are racists. | Upside sucks | Absolute travesty they are missing | Upside straight up sucks | Yea this is nuts. Upside is whatever. John’s is way better than Joes and John’s isn’t on the list. L & B hasn’t been good in a while and is just novelty and/or tourist trap at this point. No Mama’s Too? This list sucks. | I cannot tell you the sheer amount of times I've been to John's and been confused why it's praised so much. | Thought the exact same thing. | I’m heading to nyc for the first time this weekend. I’ve heard so many reviews on both sides. Some say it’s amazing and most say it’s over rated. | Only came here to see if John’s on Bleecker was on here.  No legit list doesn’t include it so I can move on. | Fixed, thank you | Dude's so eager to get angry that he didn't even look at the list. lol | I really think the quality took a big hit when the moved across the street last year. | I went once recently and it wasn’t bad per se but was just like mid.  Big fat greasy floppy slice.  Idk not at all what I expected from hearing people rave about it on here.  | The hot slice or whatever I had a few weeks ago was great, but the cheese was nothing special. | I use to eat at Scarrs 3x a week pre pandemic.  Up to 5x during workdays.  After they move.  Their old pizza makers aren’t there anymore and the quality took a dive.  It’s no different than any corner slice with just higher quality ingredients.  The old spot. Every slice was solid.  ESP their Sicilian hot boi or just corner Sicilian peep. Their cashew salad was also amazing. | Having moved from Astoria 3 years ago, I still miss Milkflower sometimes! | Here's a sneak peek of /r/GoNets using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/GoNets/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!

Just avoid chains and dollar pizza and you’ll be fine. We have plenty of slice shops and sit down spots that are perfectly fine and emblematic of how good NY pizza is. | This is subjective. My wife and I think that their plain pie is by far the best in the city | I tried it this weekend. It was very good but I’m not obsessed with it by any means.  Fini and L’Industrie nearby are definitely both better | Heard the line takes up to 2 hours and they only sell whole pies…. Who is wasting their time waiting for that | There was a line around the block on Saturday and they only do whole pies. It’s bonkers. | Correct me if I'm wrong, but he was cooking out of his apartment, then had a short stint at Superiority Burger on the midnight to 2 am shift. Basically, the number of people who have actually had his pizza is small. | Lucali is a pain in the ass even knowing people who work there. I live in the neighborhood and don't even bother.

If I want a nice sit down pizza in the area, it's Sam's or Sottocasa for me. | It’s really not that bad | I showed the article to the owner yesterday when I was gettin slices and he says all those places have the author ""gifts"" to be listed. He told him to fuck off. | I totally agree with this. I recognize pizza is personal but I recently had Lucali and, while good, it was not good enough for the effort. It was not some unworldly experience - it was high level pizza. Happy I did it, no desire to go back. | There's also one in Park Slope.  Its not destination pizza, but its a very very good neighborhood slice. | Meh, I thought it was “fine” | Is it? I had an almost wet square slice, bottom was the opposite of crispy. It was pretty bad. Maybe I got unlucky? You can vouch for it? God knows they earned a mulligan. | I can't believe how long they are taking to open that location.  How long has it been now? 4 years since they were initially supposed to open? | Thanks - fixed. | Sorry that happened to you. I’ve never experienced super long lines nor rude service. I would admit that the quality has been ever so slowly degrading but still a great pizza slice | I just wanna know good spots close to my parents’ apartment!  Oh well, I still have Frankie & Peppers on 74th or so and Amsterdam doing it right. | You are wise beyond your years my friend. | oof ok this is news to me | Yeah, please don't come out here it's definitely not worth it.... | John and Joes? I have to check them out. Never heard of them , though I’m not over that way much anymore. | [deleted] | they're great when i've gone in-store. got it twice through delivery and they were raw (legitimately raw dough inside) both times, which were separated by years in between. 

i'm not sure why there is a discrepancy between in-store and delivery! i have wondered if they par-bake the delivery ones and just didn't not cook them fully both times i got them. | When was the last time you were there? | It’s always cold. I think because the line is always insane they just put it in the oven for 20 seconds and the pizza just doesn’t taste right since it was cooked 45 minutes ago and sitting in a case. That might just be my experience but it has happened 3 times in a row so I just decided I won’t eat there again. | haven’t noticed a difference personally | its not even a matter of artisan vs classic slices. i prefer a classic slice tbh. i just think joes is underwhelming even though its often dubbed as the quintessential ny slice. 

i think there’s better places like suprema, vito’s, bleeker st, etc. lots of places in queens too that serve great slices | Complete and utter trash, used to be really good, then they became a pump and dump shop. Greasy and nasty and zero vision what so ever | I concur. That list sucks. | L&B slander is insane. Their Sicilian is the best in the city. | L&B grandma slice is still really good. Upside is meh. Best pizza is really good on a good day, no consistency though. New Park has a solid slice.  | I thought the same thing!! What do you recommend | Different styles of pizza for different folks. I love John’s. Been my favorite pizza place for decades now and has been consistently the same every time. But you gotta like that semi crispy/crunchy brick oven style to like it. 

It’s hard to compare it to a place like Joe’s around the corner where the slices are super thin and flop like a fish out of water. | Don’t overthink it. It’s the most famous for a reason | I’ve been here awhile and there’s no better overall pizza experience in the entire city in my opinion | 100% 

I only had it twice in the old spot and it was immediately different in the new place | And doing sushi | It does taste unique though, a lot of places in the city taste similar but this one tastes quite different | I think the crust is good, it tastes better than the crusts of other pizza places. I agree that the cheese (and sauce) could be better. | It was so good 3 years ago! 

It sadly no longer is. I don't know what happened, but for the last couple years it's a shadow of its former self. | fini is sub | wouldnt it make less sense to line up if they only sold slices? | He appears to have making pizza for people full time for himself for 3+ years but also worked a lindustrie for years prior to that, so actually a large number of people have eaten the pizza made by this man. His apartment pizza thing was insane, you had to order a month in advance | had it twice at superiority burger- it rules. | he also had a shorter stint in the old Superiority Burger space before he moved into their new location for late nights. His residency at SB wasn't that difficult to get a reservation for so a fair amount of people got to try his pizza. | Celebrities go there and just ruin the chances of us normal folk getting in, it's fine, it's a solid place but as you said I don't even bother either it shouldn't be a chore to pay $40 for a pie. | It was great during the pandemic when they took phone reservations for dine-in. We were there weekly on Friday at 7p seating for a few months. | >	Sottocasa

I'm surprised Sottocasa didn't make the list. Especially the one in Harlem given no uptown spots in the list. 

Their tiramisu though...magnífico! No hyperbole, I've gone back multiple times for the tiramisu (and the pizza). | The author said in the comments that the effort required to get in makes it not worth it. That's why it was left off | Everyone says that about every list they disagree with in the food world, everyone wants to say that every spot is bought. | It’s less consistent but it still slaps | I stopped by there on Friday, and the staff were attrociously awful.  Pizza was kinda disapointing too. | not sure how far up you're talking but dado's pizza in harlem is 10/10 | Actually tried it for the first time last week. I'm not sure if it was an off night, but the slices I had were awful. Their cheese slice was more of a square deep dish slice with a cornicione for some reason and had way too much cheese and couldn't hold together. Their vodka slice which was actually Detroit style was decent but served cold. I wasn't impressed and it made me miss La Rose more. | About a month ago. | I'd take the dollar pizza spot a block down any day of the week over upside. | But is it good bc it’s good or bc Portnoy says it’s good? | Making pizza at Lindustrie wasn't really making ""his"" pizza. My point stands. A relative few ate the apartment pizza or the late night SB pizza. It's great that he had prior experience but he's a relative newcomer that's built a reputation on FOMO and IG hype. That he's ""been around for years"" is generous. | Yeah. And funny enough if I am craving pizza and happen to be in South Beach, I usually go to the Lucali there, which is solid and not a huge wait.

As for Lucali in Brooklyn, Iacono's cousin's spot in South Slope, Giuseppina's, is almost the same pizza without the wait. | I had them a few times for takeout and ate at Carroll Park with some wine. We all tried to make the best of the pandemic. Cobble Hill / Carroll Gardens I felt didn't really skip a beat. Perks like an easy meal at Lucali as you say etc. | Yeah the pizza is great. And the tiramisu is indeed delicious. Always get it for dessert! | It's also randomly closed frequently for celebrity and athlete events. I'm sure they will try to turn part of the restaurant (or somewhere nearby) into a VIP room like what Ballato has. | I'm just the messenger, but he said he was approached and declined | Ok. Will give it another try. Thanks. | Just moved to Harlem - gonna check this place out | What street/ave? | Dam, last few times I was there my pizza was either soggy or burnt. I really did enjoy it before. | I hate to agree with you but kind of do, only plus is Upside has beer and a bathroom (at least the spring street one does) | Are you being fr? This place was famous for many years before he ever reviewed it (I’m not even aware of the review). Again, don’t overthink it | John's has been around since the 1930's... Probably 60 years before portnoy was even born | Don't go then. They're not gonna miss you | Just because he did not have access to capital and had to go a non traditional route in selling his pizza initially does not make him any less of a proven pizza maker than other newcomers on this list. | South Beach one was shockingly good. But maybe I was just aggressively buzzed at 11:30pm. Kind of unreal for a late night pie. | the NYT is not paying to review restaurants.... | st nicholas between 127th and 128th | This is an insane argument. I’m not denying his skill. You’re missing the point entirely. All good - I’m done here. Enjoy the pie. | Definitely a top tier pizza as far as late night drunk ones go. I've had it sober too in Miami and enjoyed it too. | It’s not the only shop in the list that has been around 5 or less years. He has a good story, his pizza is certainly better and more carefully prepared than upside, and they could’ve put prince street, mama too, best pizza, scarrs, either of the John’s or my personal favorite Bleecker street, all of which have made it on these lists before, or any of a handful of other historic contenders on the list, but part of the point of the list is to show where pizza is going, and Chrissy’s is pushing the narrative forward in a way others aren’t."
Wine Bar Pop Up,I work at a wine bar and would love to share some of cool wine maker events we’re doing around the wine fairs this fall. Is it ok for me to share here? Or is that advertising?  Don’t want to break rules but I think folks here might like it!,"I’m interested. | following | Yes, please share! | interested | share | Yes please share! What wine bar? | which one?  I’d be interested. | Thanks y'all! I work at a place called Whoopsie Daisy in Crown Heights. We're new and I love working there but we're a little off the beaten path so sometimes I feel like our food pop ups and wine maker events aren't as wild and crazy as they should be!

I will start sharing our events here. Thanks for the support!"
Need restaurant recommendations near 23rd street path station for 10 people,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for restaurant recommendations for a team lunch in the Flatiron District, close to the 23rd Street PATH station. We have some attendees with allergies to peanuts, nuts, and sesame, so options without these allergens are essential.

Our budget is $70 per person, which should cover food, drinks, tax. We’re hoping to find a place with great food and a nice ambience. We’re particularly interested in Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican, or Italian cuisine.

Thanks for your help! Also if any restaurants have prixie fix menus that would be great for 45 or 50$","Any of the restaurants in Eataly would be able to accommodate you, contact them about prix fixe options, I would guess they get business lunch groups all the time."
Nice Breakfast/Dinner Spots near Times Square,"Hi, I will be in NYC this December, staying at the Casablanca Hotel , less than a block from Times Square.

We are big fans of steakhouses, speakeasy's, or anywhere with a great vibe. Love cafes and bakeries.  

Any recommendations? ","I was just in the city (on my plane back home), I had a nice filet and lobster at Morton's off Broadway. 
Pepperoni slices at Suprema Pizzeria across from Madison Square Garden.
Bagel and sliced Lox and cream cheese at Liberty bagels two blocks away from Madison Square Garden. | Westway and Junior's for breakfast, Gallaghers and Keens for steak. | A cool speakeasy not too far from Times Square is patent pending"
Where to eat over Christmas?,"My wife and I are visiting New York for the first time at the end of the year.  We'll be there for 10 days over Christmas, and I've been tasked with finding places to eat, particularly on Christmas day.  I'm hoping you can help!

I'd really like:

* Somewhere interesting to eat on Christmas day.  Doesn't have to be a roast turkey - I'm more looking for a food van or food hall or a local favourite.  Bonus points if they do something interestingly  Christmas-ey  (deep fried stuffing? Turkey tacos? BBQ-ed... uh... BBQ-ed christmas pudding?  That kind of thing),
* Local recommendations for days that aren't the 25th December,
* Places and dishes that are unique to (or particularly good in) NYC.  Ideas so far are things like NYC-style pizza and a Jewish deli or two.  You know, places that are quintessentially NYC.

My budget is ""moderate"" - I'm not looking for fine dining and white tablecloths, but I'm happy to pay good money for good food.

It's not strictly food, but I'm also after recommendations for cocktail bars and jazz clubs!  I notice Death & Co don't post their prices online, which makes me a little apprehensive...","rolf's has some really awesome christmas decorations and good german food. a bit frills-y as it gets super packed specifically around christmas time, specifically for the christmas deco's but it's a cool experience. 

otherwise, any steakhouse would be a good option. some of my favorites are Keen's, Bowery Meat Company, Quality Meats, Striphouse

i've always loved going out for Chinese on Christmas day. Peking Duck House in Chinatown, Ollie's Sichuan in Hell's Kitchen, or really any of the multitude of Chinese eateries in Chinatown would be pretty awesome and inexpensive | Following this thread because will also be in NYC over Christmas and am seriously stressing over Christmas Day Chinese dinner with the endless options available. 

Will provide one note of value- Regarding cocktail bars- I can’t recommend Sunken Harbor Club enough. One of the most unique tiki bars I’ve ever been to | Unique to NYC:  Chopped cheese and Chino Latino."
Solo trip NYC ,"Hey everyone

I’ll be travelling to NYC from London for the first time solo in November, staying near Koreatown. If anybody has recommendations for good must try food places near that midtown area and nyc in general it would be much appreciated! Big on bakeries too but not so much dessert heavy places. I have a list already but would like to see what local New Yorkers recommend! 
Also, maybe if I decide to treat myself to a solo date night, some slightly fancy/nice restaurant recs that won’t break my bank too haha (I heard Balthazar is nice especially sat at the bar) 

Thank you in advance :) 
","What foods/cuisines to narrow it down? For example, are you looking for Korean fried chicken or burgers? Neighborhoods preferred? And what’s on your list so far? 

Often times, people will post their itinerary or list, any specific request, and those posts get more traction.

Here’s a starting point for Koreatown area:

[Good Korean Restaurants in Koreatown?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/18m9qk3/good_korean_restaurants_in_koreatown/)

[Best spots for dining solo in and around Koreatown ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bgzc9p/best_spots_for_dining_solo_in_and_around_koreatown/)

[Need recommendations around the Empire State Building](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bti1mo/need_recommendations_around_the_empire_state/)

And here’s one on “iconic” or “musts”:

[25 Iconic Dishes That Define NYC](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1ezfpcy/25_iconic_dishes_that_define_nyc_new_york_the/)

Quick bakery recs:

-	Librae
-	La Cabra
-	Radio Bakery
-	Tadaima
-	Little Flower Cafe | I would add Golden Diner (not your typical old school diner - more hip but their pancakes are delish)

Add Mama Toos when you do the west village pizza crawl along w Lindustrie

I would also add Apollos Bagels. 

I would skip Woorjip as it’s a wasted meal in terms of stomach space but if you’re looking for something quick and cheap, then itll totally do the job. 

If you’re doing KazuNori I would skip NamiNori. I found it to be over seasoned and masking the taste / freshness of the fish.

Fave KBBQ spot currently is Nubiani. They have bar seating so you won’t feel as awkward being at a whole table by yourself. 

I would also skip nom wah. Long touristy lines. I prefer Dim Sum Palace or Pings

Regarding bakeries:

La Cabra
Librae
Frenchette
Radio Bakery
Supermoon 
Dominique Ansley

For desserts, I would add:
Lady Wong
Lady M
Stick With Me
Laderach
Doughnut Plant

I would add Torrisi to the list of restaurants to eat at. You can try to do walk in a little before they open if you can’t get reservations. 

For fine dining that isn’t too expensive I would recommend Jua. Unfortunately I don’t know the price now but when I went, it was $125?  | welcome to NYC. I hope you enjoy your stay. 

google is a great tool. there are a million and one lists that covers what you are looking for. if you need some help narrowing down the options, make a new post asking for help.

&#x200B;

>(I heard Balthazar is nice especially sat at the bar)

yes. this is true. you will have a great time chatting up the bartender/staff and maybe even your fellow eaters if the are extrovert enough.

plan to walk all over NYC to work off the food. 

use google maps to help you walk around and take the subway around the city. 

if you are going to see any major sites that require tickets, make sure to book them ahead of time to avoid lines. | One tip for around Koreatown— there’s a restaurant called Woorijip that’s like a cafeteria with pre-prepared dishes for good prices. When I worked around there that was my spot for a quick and affordable dinner before heading out to after-work events, going to a bar, etc. | Sbarro. | I’m open to all foods! Just wanted to see if there was any that locals really recommend so I know it’s a solid choice or any that maybe aren’t as worth the trip

The list is huge I know haha if you can be bothered I would love to know which ones you would definitely say to go and vice versa some I definitely shouldn’t even waste my time on. Just picking out a few I would appreciate. Thank you :)) | Adding on from your list, here are things would recommend + the ones from ^ 

 Asian Food 
- Okiboru House of Tsukemen 
- Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao
- KazuNori 
- Xi’an Famous Foods or Spicy Village - Yi Ji Shi Mo, joes steam rolls, Yin Ji Chang Fen (diff kind of style - more Guangzhou I believe?), Sun Hing Lung - steamed rice rolls
- Jongro. Solid pick but I would pick Nubiani > rib no 7 (marinated kalbi is delish) > Jongro I’m actually not a fan of gopchang so can’t give you feedback there 
-  Grace Street - for desserts. Nothing spectacular though 
- Lysée - delicious but expensive. 

Would recommend  Mei Lai Wah - def try. There will be long lines though. IMO it’s too fatty vs the amt of lean meat so not a big fan anymore Diners  

Not much feedback on diners sorry! 

Bistros/Restaurants/Mexican
- Minetta Tavern - would recommend  - Strip House Steakhouse - solid but would try Del Friscos Double Eagle first if looking for a steakhouse 
- Balthazar 
- Los Mariscos 
- Los tacos no 1 
I would also add Taco Ramirez if you’re in that area. Same area as Radio Bakery (they sell out quick) 

Also recommend Birria 
- Buvette - one of my fave brunches
- Le Crocodile - solid French but wouldn’t go out of the way for it Keens Steakhouse (pricer side) - I personally was not a big fan. They’re also known for their mutton 
- Don Angie - solid but resy will be hard to get
- Carbone (again pricier side) - like Don Angie, good to try but hard to get rest 
- Maison Pickle 
 Adding:
-4Charles for prime rib but i especially love their French dip and burger (I think you can get at Au Cheval but French dip only available during dinner Service) 
- Misi 
-L’artusi    

 Pizza/Bagels/Sandwiches 
- Prince Street Pizza 
- Pizza 
- L’Industrie Pizza 
- Katz’s Deli - worth to try! 
- Di Fara Pizza - quality not the same after Dom’s passing IMO 
- Joe’s Pizza - not my fave but they’re everywhere in the city so you can always pop in and grab a slice
- Popup Bagels - recommend 
- Ess a Bagel - recommend  
- All’Antico Vinaio - love it but Italy is def better and cheaper  
- Milano Market - no feedback here but I also want to try but it’s all the way in UES so out of the way 

Desserts/Bakeries 
- Peter Pan Donuts - solid and cheap but only if you’re in the area. Walkable if you do Taco Ramirez, Radio Bakery Radio Bakery - 👍🏻  
- Eileen’s Special Cheesecake - delish - Softside - never had actually 
- Ferrara Bakery - not my fave, prefer Venieros
- Venieros - their cheesecake and strawberry shortcake is delish. Also love their pignoli cookies 
- Bread’s Bakery - known for their chocolate babka 
- Magnolia Bakery - banana pudding is good. I actually like it froze - it’s almost like eating ice cream. Skip the cupcakes 
- Levain  - used to love it, def worth trying 
- Crumbl - I actually haven’t had yet but honestly doesn’t appeal as it looks loaded w sugar but would recommend to try bcus of the hype | 
I actually do have a list I put together from google and other Reddit posts but as mentioned I just wanted to see if there was any local recommendations that I’ve missed. I find that locals know a lot of places that aren’t usually in the popular lists out there 
Definitely not an extrovert haha but will try to enjoy a nice dinner there regardless if I do go
Yes I plan to prebook tickets for museums. NYC museums aren’t free for visitors like London ones so I’ve really had to narrow down the ones I think I’ll enjoy most. I have down the MET, MoMa and the natural history. 

Thanks for the advice and the welcome regardless! | Oooh yes I have that saved for quick dinners if I’m super tired at the end of the day as it’s a short walk from my hotel! | This is a great start! We appreciate when people do their research and it’s shows what food you’re interested in. And then we can comment on it.

I’ll start with your first part: Asian food

Okiboru is great. I would also consider Shuya, Tabetomo, and Ishida. Depends what style you’re going for.

Woorijip is good for the convenience and value.

Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao is good although I’ve only been to the original location. 

Yi Ji Shi Mo is a good pick for steamed rice rolls. If you’re a big fan, you can go a rice roll crawl in Chinatown.

Xian Famous Foods is also good, although I’ve seen some mixed reviews lately. Still pretty solid to me.

For Korean BBQ, double check they allow solo dining or they may require ordering two portions. Otherwise you can get places with Korean bbq meats and not grill places if that makes sense. Olle for example.

Nom Wah isn’t known for their food. Just the vibes. Otherwise nearby, House of Joy is good.

Mei Lai Wah is solid.

Both Grace St and Lysee are great picks for dessert. | For diners, if you're mostly going for vibes those seem like good enough. Golden Diner is a modern diner to consider with amazing food.

Los Mariscos and Los Tacos No 1 are great for tacos.

Re: Pizza Prince St Pizza's owner is racist if that matters and it's not that great anymore. Scarr's Pizza also isn't as great any more according to some people here. Joe's is a decent typical NYC slice. L'Industrie and Mama's Too are really good. Other people in this sub will have stronger opinions like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1gewuul/nyt_the_25_best_pizza_places_in_new_york_right_now/).

Katz is one of those places that touristy but lives up to the hype as seen here: [What places are overhyped but actually deserve it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1g8vcwt/what_places_are_overhyped_but_actually_deserve_it/)

[Crumbl aint it at](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1g6pq1f/why_has_crumbl_in_the_west_village_had_huge_ass/) least for NYC where we have plenty of places with good cookies. Levain is at least good and so is Culture Espresso ([my fav and many people's fav](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bqp2hc/rating_of_all_the_cookies_in_nyc/)) for chocolate chip cookies. | >Definitely not an extrovert haha but will try to enjoy a nice dinner there

I think once people hear your UK accent, they will strike up a convo with you regardless if you want it or not. lol

dont forget bagels and pizza. dining for one is tough b/c you can only eat so much and you want to try everything on the menu. maybe take a food tour? [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=food+tour+nyc](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=food+tour+nyc) (honestly not sure which ones are good/bad). I did one like like 10 years ago and it was fun to learn stuff i didnt know about the areas.

as for a date night for 1, check [resy.com](http://resy.com) and see what is available. i think there are places that do special tasting menus for solo diners, i could be wrong.

look for holiday markets. now that its Nov, there will be alot of holiday markets. Bryan park is one of them. might not be as good as the ones in London, but its something to check out.

[https://www.timeout.com/newyork](https://www.timeout.com/newyork) for stuff that is happening the week you are here.

walk across the brooklyn bridge into DUMBO and enjoy the area/view.

look up Brooklyn Heights Promenade

check out [https://ny.eater.com/](https://ny.eater.com/) for their food maps and new opening list. | > I think once people hear your UK accent, they will strike up a convo with you regardless if you want it or not. lol

Oh dear haha I would think that’s not so much of a thing now as surely there’s lots of Londoners in nyc. There are definitely a lot of Americans in London right now, I hear the accent wherever I go

Ooh yes I love a good Christmas market! Wasn’t sure my they would be open as I’m going on the 18th but I’ll try finding some that have started by then. Sounds like the Bryant park will be, thanks for the rec! 

There’s so much to eat, I’m definitely going to pile on the pounds 😂"
Anniversary dinner date suggestions,"I'm having my first anniversary with my wife this December and wanted to take her to a good restaurant that is wallett friendly. Comment your favorite places or top picks.

We would think of ourselves as foodies (at least that's what we think lol).

We both love Hispanic, European and Asian cuisine.

We are looking to stay within Brooklyn and Manhattan area please.

It doesn't have to be a fancy restaurant necessarily. The most important is that it has great food and it's a nice place to sit down, talk and have a good time.

Any suggestions would be much appreciated! Thank you","Le Coucou | My partner and I like the odeon for our special nights out. Unpretentious, no need to worry about reservations, fast service, and good food."
Best place for frozen dumplings and soup dumplings in Brooklyn Chinatown (7 and 8 ave 48-60 st sunset)?,Would like to know the best place for frozen dumplings and the best place for soup dumplings in this area.,"Kai Feng Fu is my favorite for frozen dumplings. The other spot that's closeby is Great Taste Dumplings. 

You can always buy a small order of dumplings to try them out first but IMO Kai Feng Fu has the doughier and thicker wrapping and I like the option to pan fry them so I like Kai Feng Fu better.

There's actually a shit ton of Fuzhou hole in the wall noodle and dumpling spots on 8th ave, probably at least 1 in every block. I don't speak or understand Fuzhounese so it's hard for me to order and most of them have barely any reviews lol. I also find that most of them only have boiled dumplings with the thinner skin.

---

There's basically no good soup dumplings spot on 8th ave that's worth a shit. 

There's a Yozi chain that opened up a year or two so but it's a fast food chain, super meh and does not scratch the soup dumplings itch.

You can try Gong Fu Xiao Long Bao, but it's a Fuzhounese Xiao Long Bao. It's doughier and its more like a pan fried pork bun so don't expect anything like a typical Shanghai Soup Dumpling. It's DIRT cheap at $5 for a full tray of 8 buns. It's probably one of the cheapest eats that you can find in the city so its worth a try. 

(Most of those small hole in the wall Fuzhou noodle shops also have these type of pan fried buns) | Agreed- I've tried a bunch of XLB places in Sunset park and none hit.

The place in Fei Long Market is Mid too | Thanks will give Kai and great taste a try. Know anything about soup dumplings at dins kitchen on 7th Ave around 53 st? | charred scallion oil noodles at yozi are pretty satisfying, also the ""dumplings"" that are not closed, sort of like a fried row of chinese dumpling skin tacos-i thought it looked like a chain, but they told me it wasnt. where are the other ones?

what is an example of a good XLB? i have enjoyed soup dumplings at both yozi and shanghai dumpling (in fei long) so i'm interested in what you think is excellent. 

love Kai feng fu for fried dumplings. 

in the neighborhood i generally hit park asia, dun huang, little thanh da, wong wong noodle. 

what am i missing out on???? | Yeah I agree that the XLB stall at Fei Long Market was mid. 

Sometimes, I would randomly see a comment on here talking about how great the XLB at the food court was and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I felt like they were the ONLY XLB spot in the neighborhood and it was the only reason why they got business lol.

I think there's definitely a market for a Shanghainese/XLB shop in the Brooklyn Chinatowns because the same goes for Bensonhurst. Mr Bun is super mid as well (and I hate their generic meh menu lol). Liu Shanghai is the only spot that has a good XLB that scratches the itch. | hasn't the interior food court at fei long been closed since covid? i haven't been since, i don't think. passed by yesterday and the doors on the 8th ave side were covered over and had a giant closed sign on them.

i miss the guy on the exterior (on 8th) that had scallion pancakes. | Nope, I saw it on google maps earlier but I've never been. The oldest review on google maps is from 9 months ago so they're relatively new. | thank you for this-dins looks good, gonna try em out | Yozi has 3 locations (Bensonhurst, 8th ave, Flushing) that all popped up within the last 2-3 years. I assumed that it was a chain from China since they expanded so quickly and a mom and pop store isn't going to expand that fast. 

When I try to google it, I couldn't find anything to say they are from China. Their website is down but I did find a old snapshot of their site where they claim that they have a ""original recipe from 2011"" so they had to have come from somewhere lol.

\---

If I were going specifically for XLBs, I'd probably go to Deluxe Green Bo in Chinatown. They are good and cheap and usually my go to.

Nan Xiang is also ""good"" but I feel like it's a bit overrated. I've only been to the Midtown location, and I don't think they are significantly that much better than Deluxe Green Bo to warrant paying extra for. I think I'd only go here if I am craving XLB in midtown and too lazy to go to Chinatown lol.

Liu Shanghai is also a good option in Bensonhurst, but I go more for their absolutely delicious Fish Head Casserole/Soup than their XLB.

\---

I'm actually not a big fan of the Chinese food on 8th ave. There's a lot of good places, but not that many that really ""stands out"".

[Ba Xuyen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZWtf4Lv8bi3ghG8K6) has pretty good Banh Mi. If you do go, try to get there either in the morning or early afternoon. Every time I went there after lunch hours, the sandwich is always sad and meh.

[Ohayo Bread House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aT9vrZhiD6Kex3Dv7) is a newish bakery that popped up. They have like \~30 different onigiris that you can pick from. The onigiris are not that amazing but I think the selection stands out.

[Ng's Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bd8921wULVXRQrL56) and [Fei Long Spicy Hot Pot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M5SRW5tu5CM6Htmm8) are stalls that used to be at the Fei Long Food Court. Since the food court never reopened, they opened their own stores. 

My Taiwanese coworker goes religiously to Ng's Kitchen every Sunday and swears that they have the best Roast Duck. Don't confuse them with Uncle Ng's Recipe (they're a few blocks away).

[Hainan Chicken House](https://maps.app.goo.gl/w3SZfg4ocmCbGcFU7) is every food critic's (Peter Wells/NYtimes/Infatuation/Eater) favorite new restaurant last year when they opened. I kinda felt like most of the reviewers were not Asian or haven't had much Malayasian food because they were gushing over their Hainanese chicken rice but it just kinda tasted like typical Hainanese chicken to me so maybe try some of the other dishes. 

I do like their roast pork though. I've never had Malayasian style roast pork so maybe this is ignorance on my part but it taste pretty different than typical Chinese Roast Pork and they use a much fattier cut. It's also like $18/lbs vs $11/lbs at Ng's Kitchen. IDK if it's worth a 60% markup but IMO It's worth trying at least once. 

(For what it's worth, I brought for my parents for dinner and they were like the roast pork is okay lol)

I also like [Hong Kong Dim Sum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uDQyDVBFs616Kij26). Nothing special, just your typical hole in the wall, mom and pop, rice noodle/congee spot but it's the only one in the area and I don't feel like there's one in Bensonhurst either.

Not my recommendation but DinerEnBlanc is the resident egg tart expert and [was on a quest to find the ""Best"" egg tart in NYC](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1bh5usq/a_tasting_of_egg_tarts_part_3/). 

In one of the earlier egg tart threads, he said that [Xiao Le Yuan Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a7whDX4KjN1Fu3H39) was his favorite egg tart in Sunset Park. And while you're on 5th ave, I would recommend stopping by [Antojitos Mexicanos Deli](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kt8zsbPUTDgXDAWSA) a block away for some delicious tacos (I liked the lamb barbacoa) and other Mexican small eats/snacks. | Thank you-

yozi always felt like a chain, from a design and build perspective. i like the charred scallion oil noodles, but haven't really strayed too far from that

you should try the banh mi at little thanh da-much better than ba xuyen, especially the roast pork only version

oh shit i'm definitely gonna hit ohayo for the musubi.

ate at hainan and the roast pork was really good, i agree

will try hong kong dim sum for some rice rolls for sure

i wouldn't ever go to Antojito mexicanos deli.  but if i did go-tinga cemita. not on the menu but maybe the best sandwich in nyc. (i love them so much) | i meant to ask-do you speak chinese? neighborhood really makes me wish i did. | I speak Cantonese but it's honestly not really that helpful in Sunset Park.

It feels like nowadays, most of the Chinese population speaks Mandarin and the recent wave of immigrants speaks Fujianese. If I went into a random store/restaurant speaking Cantonese, there's probably like a 70% chance that they won't understand it and I'm better off speaking to them in English lol. | interesting-i was under the impression most of bk sunset park spoke cantonese!"

Tikka masala momos?,"In Toronto this summer I practically had an out-of-body experience eating momos served in a pool of tikka masala sauce (and there were also other curries to choose from). I’ve had momos at a couple places around Manhattan and in Jackson Heights, but I’ve never come across this particular combination, which I’ve been craving for months now.

Is there anywhere to get Romani food in the city?,"I went into a bit of a Wikipedia rabbit hole last night and was reading about the Roma people. I was shocked to see that the United States apparently has the largest population of people with Romani ancestry anywhere in the world. That said, I had to look up what traditional Romani food is, and every search for it here came up with only Romanian food results (also great, but not what I’m looking for). Would love to hear any recs/experiences.","So, part of the issue is that there are many sub-groups of Romani based on where they 'settled' -  my family is ethnically Lovari (from around Hungary) and will have completely different traditional foods than someone that's from, say, Spain or Turkey. There really isn't a monolithic 'Romani' food type.

In my experience (which again, is the opposite of universal since it's such a varied group of people) 'traditional' Romani food tends to hew pretty closely to the region they were in- my grandmother's traditional recipes for example, tended to mostly just be Hungarian with some slight tweaks, and her favorite food in the city was a weird Hungarian place in what seemed like a rec center basement. | I wouldn’t skip over Romanian food. Since Romani are nomadic, their cuisine changes and picks up local flavors wherever they are, and Romania has a lot of isolated Romani communities. There are large Romani populations across Eastern and Southern Europe and the Balkans—especially in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary—so that’s the kinds of cuisines you’re looking for. So it's Danubius and Romanian Garden in Sunnyside, Kafana in Alphabet City (it's Serbian, but close enough), Karczma and Restaurant Relax in Greenpoint (it's Polish and there used to be a large community there, but they were violently persecuted during WWII and it wasn't much better afterwards). | Haven’t been yet but this Romanian restaurant looks delicious [https://maps.app.goo.gl/FuzQMr8X9LBKcfkd6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FuzQMr8X9LBKcfkd6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy) | Is it derogatory to call them Gypsies? Because they are one in the same and may get you better answers than “Romanian Food” | This place? 

https://yelp.to/bdao_yjqhq | As a Hungarian Romani same, it’s basically Hungarian food for special meals and a lot of throwing whatever you have in a pot and seasoning it with paprika | Thanks for the perspective! This reminds me of the differences between Ashkenazi food and Sephardic and Mizrahi foods in the wider Jewish community. | I’ve had Romanian food and love it. | lol, not what I’m looking for, but it does look delicious. Romani or Roma people are not Romanian—totally different culture/ethnicity/history. | It's derogatory, yeah. We're not talking fighting words in the US where people usually use it out of total ignorance that there's any issue with it since they tend to be so unfamiliar with Roma in general (I've had to convince people that we're not *actually* fictional), but think of it similarly to calling someone that's Indigenous American a Red Indian or someone from Asia Oriental. Much less mild outside of the US though.

Any of that aside, googling 'gypsy food' is DEFINITELY going to get you like, recipes from someone's DnD game or a boho pinterest board, not anything culturally useful. | It was on the UES but *exactly* the same vibe. | and here i thought you were linking to famed hungarian restaurant Bdao Yjghq | A lot of Romani have been in the states for a while and eat typical American foods. Source: the reality tv shows about the Roma families (which is amazing!). | As a Hungarian that grew up on the UES I’m very curious about that spot. | This inspired me to try to find it since I haven't been since she passed years ago, but I can't find anything.

Allegedly it's closed as the building had to be sold in 2019.

* I have budgeted about $1500 total. We don't drink too much when we go out to eat which makes me feel like this budget is feasible. 
* I'd like to do 7 different types of food aka not all Italian. We are adventurous, and comfy exploring all five boroughs.
* Always down for a good tasting menu, but given budget and desire for variety I'm okay with menu options and cheaper eats.

Most importantly, I understand that getting 7 in-demand dinner reservations in close proximity is likely not feasible. The places themselves do not need to be beautiful and romantic, or even famous! I just want us to try good food. 

What are your favorite restaurants that may have fallen from the cultural zeitgeist, are generally easier to get reservations for, or could be a fun option for an anniversary dinner? ","You'll also be gaining 7lbs for the 7 years you've been together! Lol | So, you're looking at about $100pp/m

Honestly, I think there's enough popular places that you could do that without too much of a stretch.

The 'close to $100' tasting menus makes me think of (these can be harder, but not ridiculous):

* Dirt Candy
* Four Horsemen
* 63 Clinton actually way over $100 b/c you probably want the handroll)
* Sushi on me (people seem to like the Queens one more)

Sub $100 but cool makes me think of Traif and Xixa (which then gives you some room over the $100 for some meals).

I'd encourage you to include a splurge night at a perennial favorite.  Maybe a local place you go to a lot, but get all of your favorite things, etc.

I shill for [Overthrow](https://www.overthrowhospitality.com/) a lot, so if you wanted something vegan in there, they have a place that's probably set dressed to match your vibes (Ladybird is small plates in bright pastels, too pretty for me.  Third Kingdom is dark wood with weird decorations, I love it, you have to get the mole.  Avant Garden and Soda Club are a bit on the 'safe' side New American vs Pasta/Wine Bar)."
 3 days in Times Square need recommendations ,"Hi y’all!

I’ll be traveling to NYC next week and staying in Times Square with my father who is legally blind. We are looking for the best recommendations in the area for pizza, dinner, sandwiches, whiskey but anything else helps! I’d love to hear the best local spots that fly under the radar but are heavy hitters!

Thanks! ",
40yo couple visiting around New Years,"We’re visiting NYC in late December/early January for a week, and I’m looking for recommendations on which neighborhood to stay in. We’re very adventurous eaters and love a good cocktail (though, quality over quantity is our mantra these days). I’ve been to NYC before but hubby hasn’t. Not looking to do any of the typical tourist stuff. Where would you recommend we stay for awesome food options and creative cocktails (trying to avoid touristy and college party vibe neighborhoods)? 

Also any NYE celebrations/events recommendations (not in time square) and general can’t miss cocktail bars and restaurants would be amazing! Thanks in advance!! ","I’d say east village when it comes purely to food / drink, but prob has a bit of college party vibe (a lot of the city does, esp neighborhoods with good food and drink)

Maybe Greenwich village, there are pockets of more chill streets but ultimately almost anywhere worth staying is gonna be busy with people out drinking to an extent. Maybe also Williamsburg / Greenpoint if you’re ok with being in BK | Stay in Williamsburg ! So many cool hotels and easy access to Manhattan | staying around union square would be a good spot imo. you have access to essentially all trains so you can get around the city easily, it's pretty central, and a lot of cool stuff within walking distance. | Dear Irving on Hudson would be a great place for you, while it’s in the Times Square area it’s an elegant atmosphere with fantastic drinks and unforgettable views. Amor y Amargo in the East Village is another worthwhile stop, especially if you like Italian bitters. For really good, but not “wow-I’ve-never-had-a-cocktail-like-this-before” drinks, with a super unique atmosphere, check out the Bar Room at the Beekman, and definitely make sure to look up at the ceiling in the atrium. Another fun double stop could be the whiskey bar at Fraunce’s Tavern for the history, followed by a trip to Dead Rabbit nearby. | I'd stay at a nice hotel in either West Village / Tribeca or Williamsburg for convenience.

Martiny's or Overstory for a cocktail is a must"
Where to find candy apples,Basically the title. I can’t seem to find any store that sells candy apples. ,
Favorite Place or Best Area for Mexican Food?,"A group of friends went to Mexico City last May and we want to have a reunion meal. It was a culinary adventure for us, stopping at Pujol and Quintonil between the millions of tacos we ate.

I've lived in NYC about a decade but have never really found a Mexican joint that really stands above the rest. I am looking for a recommendation for favorite sit-down Mexican spots (6 of us) in the BK/Queens/Manhattan areas. We also like an adventure so if there's an area with a couple spots close to each other, we like a short restaurant/taco crawl.

Appreciate any recommendations!","Mexican here, also own a restaurant in BK. You may need to specify a little bit more as with any type of food Mexico has many offerings, you would not get the best pasta and the best pizza at the same place for example. Here are some of my favs:

Cosme, Atla, Aldama, Taco Mix, Cruz del Sur, Chabelas, El Rey (Queens), Tacos No.1, Mariscos el Submarino 

I argue all the time with friends from different states and regions in Mexico so I am not gonna adventure to rank them. Just try them.

I want to say tho, a lot of random places stand out in NY for me that grew up this things and ate them all over Mexico, it’s just that your experience may be different, I once took my boss from SF to the best Mexican burritos in Mexico and he nonchalantly said he preferred el Farolito in SF, my recommendation would be to pick the place based on the dish you want and not the other way around. | La contenta

For cheap (but tasty) tacos and strong margs, taqueria | Just go to Roosevelt Avenue around 86th street and pick any Mexican restaurant around | La Morada in Mott Haven is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. Currently it is only open in the afternoon on weekdays, so it may not fit your schedule, but it is definitely worth a visit. | Tacos #1. | Panzón in GP. Pricey but soooo worth it. | Casa Enrique, Taqueria Ramirez or Oxomoco for more elevated Mexican food. For a taco crawl, I think bushwick is a good neighborhood. Taqueria Al Pastor can go toe to toe with some of the Al pastor I’ve had in mxco, and there’s a bunch of other good taco spots in the area | Check out Alma Negra in Brooklyn. | Taco crawl - 116th between 2nd & 3rd. There’s a couple sit down spots in that area but haven’t tried. Can def recommend taco mix & dona Maty quesadillas | East Harlem. Mexican places all over. Near 116th on East Side. | Native New Yorker who's spent a decent amount of time in GDL and DF - these are the spots where the vibes/flavors are closest to what I've heard there: 

\- Cafe Miguel / La Chilaqueria / For All Things Good for Condesa brunch vibes (and in the case of For All Things Good, Oaxacan items)

\- Panzon / Aldama for Roma Sur evening vibes

\- Casa Carmen for Polanco evening vibes

\- Cruz Del Sur for Colonia Americana/GDL vibes

\- Don Pepe Tortas for Centro vibes | Greenpoint is a great choice. 

Taqueria El Chato for tacos trompo, Taqueria Ramirez for tacos campechano, and Mariscos El Submarino for sinaloa style seafood. Not a big Mexican neighborhood or something but all top tier places | Tacos el bronco in Brooklyn. The restaurant not the truck although it’s good as well | Some of my faves that serve food you’d get in Mexico 

Bedstuy - For all things good

LES - Atla, Cosme

Sunset Park - Tacos El Bronco, Alma Negra

Greenpoint - Taquria Ramirez | El Cantinero on university place | Corona plaza got the goods | Cruz del Sur is fantastic. The restaurant is on Washington Avenue and they have a taco spot on Dean Street. | Los Mariaches in Brooklyn | Esse Taco in Williamsburg is run by Enrique Olvera who also owns Pujol and is a good spot for a part of a crawl. | My favorite is Noche Mexicana on the UWS | Gonna get hate but Pedro Pascal was right in saying there’s not much here. 🤷‍♀️ | [deleted] | [deleted] | I'm curious about something. Is there a reason that most Mexican restaurants in NYC have a very similar menu?

This doesn't seem to be based on where in Mexico the owners are from, since the menu tends to be mostly pan-Mexican with maybe a dish or two unique to the region. I looked at menus of restaurants from Puebla for instance, and they're considerably different from what you see in the average Mexican restaurant in NYC. | Where do you think can I get something close to El Faralito here… | This is a solid list. no RAMIREZ in Greenpoint? Taqueria or carnetitas? Casa Enrique as well. El bronco.

Roosevelt Ave. East Harlem. Taco mix, Los Mariscos and taqueria  Ramirez. For me. 

Ramirez's is TONY right now. (Top of NY for anyone that doesn't know 90s NY rap music)

Ps thanks for the Health department lesson, I'm obsessed with spit roasted meats. But never done them in professional setting in NY. This explains so much of why weee behind in pastor and shawarma | Yea been goin here for a while & can agree. | Is this on 6th Ave? | Yup! my favorite spot is Taqueria Coatzingo | Good call forgot about morada | Wtf is up with those new hours? Haven't been there since COVID because of them. | Jalapeño deli burrito hits | I agree with you | Arepera Guacuco and Patacon Pisao are Venezuelan restaurants with absolutely no Mexican influence. | I don’t want to out myself 😂 | The market mostly, we tried to serve food from our region and some people gets upset or they don’t want to learn or things like that. Margins are thin so it’s a hard balance to get every variable right to make it a profitable business.

It’s funny, sometimes we would cook something that to me is is amazing and people hated it and viceversa, sometimes people praises a dish that I try and think, what the hell are we serving?? 😂😂

Lastly the health department needs to evolve, we cannot do pastor or carnitas the way they do in Mexico because we get fined.

But that’s gonna change in the next years with more people traveling, Brooklyn is great sometimes because more people is looking for the good stuff 😂 | Maybe B’Klyn Burro  or Super burrito, I like Mexican burritos more but every now and then I go and get my Mission fix there, granted I am not an expert on American Burritos like mission style but I like those.

The ""problem"" with burritos is that the flour tortilla need to be done with lard and in NYC most people use oil to make it vegan friendly which removes a lot of the flavor, healthier tho, but less flavor. | Ah, so with Ramirez I may be on the wrong side of things and I wouldn’t go unless my friends take me there. Most of my friends (from the North of Mexico) love them. I am from the south so Pastor, Suadero and tripa are staples there and I may be overly critical here.

What I love:

- Trend setters, they were some of the first to get the idea right, bold and for the most part unique until the rest arrived
- flavors are there and in general I like the vibe

Why I don’t list it:

- I like tripe and suadero and at least until the last time I went there they were not simmering it in fat an at that point is a brisket taco, I didn’t like that they torch the tripe, it won’t cook properly at least for a tripe taco.
- I hated the flow to order, I just want to order the taco and eat it, but there in this case there was an order, then someone telling you where to go and sit once ready, then I go and put cilantro and onions and rinse and repeat. Maybe it was an odd day. 

I also love Cosme but didn’t care for Esse Taco too much for example, I think they missed the mark with the tortilla and Olvera ought to ser hand made tortillas but what do I know? | Yup their west village location is on the corner of 6th Ave and 11th st

Other (original) location is LES. I was skeptical when they opened the WV location but both are solid | Both good but wrong country bruh | Damn, a small business owner who refuses free promotion?!?! Your spot must be amazing | Is it one of the places you named as your favs??? At least give us a clue :) | Oh can you say more about what you can't do for carnitas and pastor? Curious what's missing. | What dishes would you like to sell but feel like you can't for the reasons you mentioned?

And I noticed that taqueros cook al pastor on the flat top after it's shaved off the trompo, is that what you were referring to? | My man, this is a solid rundown. To each their own. Haven't made it to esse yet; cosme is a great treat. Had a few good meals at Atla as well. Still need to make it to Claro.

Taco mix is better than ever these days IMHO. | Cool I’ll check it out thanks! | Hehe, self promotion is a two edged sword | It is, but I am biased too! | The way the health department inspects pork you need to show that every piece is at certain temperature, but carnitas and pastor shouldn’t be shredded we usually keep them in big pieces , the whole idea in Mexico is to play with textures and different degrees of fat. 

Pastor also is usually exposed in Mexico and they don’t like that in NY, there is a lot of tricks that shawarma places use including quickly removing the “trompo” and putting it in the oven if there is an inspection

In general my view is that the rules enforced are outdated and need to be modified to embrace new food but that’s just me. | A silly example is that in Mexico we don't generally use chips, we mostly use tostadas (fried tortillas) but people outright refuses to use their hands to break the tostadas in to chips 

Menudo or Pancita, tripe tacos, cabeza, for example, my grandma use to eat chayote with cream cheese, and I would never be able to sell that.

All in all things are improving, but sometimes we have to stop fighting people. Sometimes we actually refuse to do certain things, like adding cheese to carnitas. :) | For suadero Taco Mix is the undisputed champ for sure | This is wild to me. Explains so much tbh | Are there any guisos or moles (other than Poblano) that you'd sell if you could? | My biggest WTF moment was to explain a judge why carnitas should not be shredded and have a lower core temperature (2 degrees) to avoid a fine. Judge never ruled, we still paid the fine and moved on. | Yeah, one of the worst feelings is to know most home made dishes don’t get to be known, moles are somewhat for parties and the rest of the menus in NYC serve what we consider fast food, so “real” food never makes it out there.Would love to see 

1. Mole verde (not pipián)
2. Clemole
3. Mole de Olla (a soup)
4. Lengua en salsa de cacahuate
5. Albóndigas
6. Chicharrón or queso  en salsa verde 

All of that is also usually healthier than the tacos we get more often than not. | What does carnitas ramirez or that one bushwick spot do you think? Fly undercover? | I was curious about the difference between pipian and verde. I occasionally see the former on menus.

Maybe you could do a rotating special thing to see what new dishes people would like | Where can i get the best lengua? Plz say your restaurant | I think is easier to make it work when that’s your main offering, say you only do carnitas or pastor, you can either eat the fine (twice a year) or be ready with a process to avoid it. I think.

Need to try the carnitas place, I like that they sell nana and buche which is my favorite combo | Yes, we’ve been toying with the idea of a “plat du jour” and do one different to give a fonda vibe and an affordable lunch special. | I actually think our lengua taco is super good, but we don’t do lengua dishes just the taco. | It was great (carnitas Ramirez) i still need to try la perra hambre if still going | Where is the place? Feel free to DM me"
PDT Resy Question,"Does anyone know when the reservations are released on Resy? It looks like 5 days in advance, but not sure what time exactly.

"Nice Dinner on a Sunday, ideally midtown but willing to consider other neighborhoods.","Planning for a business trip in a month or so, have time for a dinner on Sunday night and was hoping to get something close to my hotel in Midtown east, like the lounge/bar at Aquavit or Daniel, something nice and memorable without being a long tasting menu experience, but everything I've found has been closed on Sundays or doesn't offer reservations for solo diners. Going to Butter on saturday night, so that's out, and places like Balthazar or Minetta Tavern sound nice but are pretty far from the hotel. Daniel Lounge sounds perfect but they don't offer reses for solo diners, could I walk in? Any other recs would be appreciated!","If you like seafood, Marea might be a good choice | Cafe Carmellini is great | I can assure you can solo walk-in pretty much anywhere, especially on Sunday. 

Sounds like you got a type of what you looking for pointing out Minetta and Balthazar so why just don’t spend 15 minutes on a train and get what you want? 

People don’t go to midtown on Sundays, unless they are lost (either geographically or mentally) or tourists, that’s why many establishments are closed in that area during Sundays or even throughout the entire weekends. | i mean getting to minetta tavern or balthazar are both a matter of a pretty short subway ride and then a short stroll through nice neighborhoods. idk why you would limit yourself like this. that being said, did you look into cafe boulud | Monkey Bar | I shouldve explained the problem I was wondering about with walkin/res, Daniel only offers reservations for 1 in the dining room, not the lounge, and as far as I can tell Per Se doesn't have that option at all. I was hoping for either Aquavit or Le Bern bar, but neither are open on sunday and I was wondering what would be closest to those. Daniel seems good but if the lounge doesn't take solo diners, Cafe Boulud would be a good backup. | cafe boulud definitely looks really promising, I'll check them out more | Alright, by saying you can walk-in pretty much anywhere I was thinking about old-school, casual, French restaurants you mentioned not ** and ***. That’s a different game. 
Good luck, especially with such a short notice."
Date Night Recommendation - Delice & Sarrasin in the WV (Vegan French),"Decided to take a risk for the 6-month anniversary of my wedding last night and check out Delice & Sarrasin. It's a Vegan French restaurant that I haven't seen brought up here a lot. My husband (omnivore) and I (vegetarian) both really enjoyed our dishes. He had ""beef"" bourguignon and I had ""duck"" in tarragon and mustard. We shared ""foie gras"" for an appetizer and an orange creme brulee for dessert - I legitimately forgot the place was vegan when eating the creme brulee. The ambience is very romantic and they've got a good selection of vegan wines (though most are bottle only, not by the glass). ","That place is such a gem! | I’ve been there recently and it’s a nice concept indeed. I had the baked Brie, Sarrasin Crepe and Crepe Suzette, and my fellow diners had variations of French classics. When visiting, one needs to put aside expectations of the dishes tasting « exactly like the original » as the texture and mouthfeel of vegan options are always a bit different, but this was really nice in execution. Good option for a night out with vegans/vegetarians, or curious eaters. | I've been there twice (I think once was for an anniversary as well)! I just want to add my recommendation to the pile. ~~The orange crème brûlée remains one of the best desserts I've ever had.~~ EDIT: Oh, no, sorry, it was the dark chocolate mousse. Man, I should go again. | Yes! The owners and chefs, Christophe and Yvette are also both so kind and amazing folks :) | It's a really good spot, even for me as a happy meat eater. Very small and cozy spot. Delicious vegan substitutes for classics and they really do nail a lot of the taste and feel (despite somehow not having access to actual butter). 

My only complaint (the food is great, and really satisfying) - is that the wine menu is 100% vegan and as a result can be super hit or miss. Natural wines (which covers most of the list) are kind of... meh. Most people won't care as much as I do, of course. | And he's a model too"
Recs for tofu-centered meals?,"I visit NYC every couple of months to be a tourist and see a museum or zoo. And to eat! I am not a vegetarian, but i LOVE tofu, and I’d like another tofu-centric meal when I visit again in November. So far, I’ve been to CDG and BCD Tofu House. I’m not opposed to going back to those (esp BCD), but I’d love to hear more suggestions. I am allergic to shellfish and dairy, but I am very open to trying new things. ","Soon doo boo is great but I also love Mapo Tofu. Szechuan Mountain House has a good one. | Any preferred neighborhoods?

Some ideas:

- Tofu tofu
- Daesung Korean Noodle
- SGD Sogongdong Tofu & BBQ
- Fong On
- 46 Mott
- Soybean Chan | Spicy moon!! They have several locations around the city. It’s a vegan restaurant with multiple tofu options, their mapo tofu is to die for"

 Ess a Bagels still the shit?,"Looking for top notch sesame bagels with sliced Lox and Cream cheese for breakfast tomorrow.
I'm near Times Sq, is Ess A's still the place?","Liberty Bagels is closer and probably better. | Best Bagels & coffee guys, it was 2 1/2 blocks from me and absolutely delicious.
Thanks for the tip, Yelp reviews also backed up what you guys said | I'll try Liberty bagel tomorrow and let you guys know | For many of us, Ess-A is what we are looking for in a good bagel. You should also check out Best Bagels on 35th and 7th. But for the breakfast you’re talking about, for me it would be Russ & Daughters and their Gaspe Nova smoked salmon | Kossars | Best bagel is my favorite hands down | Liberty is 10x better IMO | I’ve had Tal bagel, Tompkins, and Russ & daughters 3 days in a row. 

Best bagel IMO is Tal followed by Tompkins although Russ has a horseradish cream cheese that is fire. 

All 3 are an excellent choice. | I think the best bagel in NYC anyone who says appalo bagel is best is just a tik tok airhead | Tal bagels better | Yes | Ess is not great too big andbdoighy. Best bagel coffee or utopia for that area | Some [mixed reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1ga8b66/how_could_the_nytimes_leave_out_essabagel/) from here recently. | Early, formative entrant in the ""softball"" bagel category. Detestable, imo. | I went there over the weekend and was underwhelmed, still on the search of the best bagel | Hard to beat the Pumpernickel from Essa. Get it scooped if it’s too think for ya. | I just had it recently.  Its still amazing.  I tried liberty but the line was ridiculous.  I suggest ordering online and just picking it up.  Liberty was pretty good too.  I don't think you can go wrong either way. | Their fresh bagels picked up from the back are great. 

But when you order a bagel sandwich, they are terrible for some reason.. I don’t know if they use different bagels for the sandwiches but every time I order one, even if just a bagel with cream cheese, the bagel is dense, hard and unappetizing. | No | Liberty followed by Tompkins Square. BLACK seed are different style but their bec and Almond butter jelly are the bomb.

Also good is Brooklyn Bagel. | Why nobody mentions Leos bagels :( to me their sooo good and pretty big sized, do I just have a bad taste | Broad Nosh on 58th is pretty damn good | ess a bagel is not the shit it is quite simply just shit these days, also on top of that Alyses Jacobson can go fuck herself and learn to run a business. | BEST Bagel & COFFEE PLEASE! 
That will be my last bite before death! Toasted Cinnamon Raisin Bagel from BBC.  | Went back to Essa last weekend after having good memories from 5 years ago. There was a horrendously long line, but we stuck it out because we were trying to solve a dispute on which bagel place we like best. We ordered an Everything Bagel with Scallion Cream Cheese, and a Bacon, Egg & Cheese. There was barely any cream cheese filling in ours, or in the peoples' around us, and Everything seasoning ONLY on the top half of the bagel. The BEC was worse, with pre-made eggs, barely any bacon, just no. 

My husband used to live on the UES and swears by Tal or H&H. He's also a fan of Utopia, but we haven't tried the new Manhattan location yet. 

Safe to say we're not going to Essa ever again. | Ess a bagel isn’t bad but nowhere near the top choices in my opinion. 

Full lox and cream cheese: Zabars or Utopia  

If you want to pull a (unnecessary complicated pro-move): Fish from Barney Greengrass or Russ and Bagel from Liberty/ Tompkins Sq and assemble yourself | No | Over expensive and completely average bagels. | Bagel 3/5 bacon egg and cheese on bagel 2/5 overall 2.5/5 | No | Never was | Bagel Oasis remains undefeated in every category except ease of access | Murrays kills em | Zucker’s all the way

The last time I went to Ess-a-bagel I was pretty disappointed with my lox on sesame. Had like 2 slices of onion in it smh | Liberty for the win! | liberty and tompkins are the best i’ve had | Do! We always go to Ess-a-bagel on our last day in NYC but next time I go I'm headed there solo. Not sure I want to wait in the Ess-a-bagel line. Might want to try somewhere new! | Love the Salmon and Sable there. Sadly the bagels are just OK. | Best bagels is fantastic | I grabbed H&H in moniyhan to bring to work because it was easy on my commute.  my team was hated them. They were pretty bad. I introduced them to Best Bagels and redeemed myself. Truly the best. | I must say, I never understood the hype. I had an egg&cheese, avocado and tomato, and it want anything spectacular. | Apollo is objectively good sourdough, but not sure I would count it as a real bagel. Quality-wise it’s way better than ess-a-bagel currently though. Ess-a has noticeably declined post covid | Used to live on First Ave one block away from Ess a and three blocks away from Tal. My mornings were always filled with indecision, but I always ended up happy | Absolute Bagels better than Tal | No the fuck it’s not 

Your comment is from almost a day ago and normally I’d just keep scrolling but I simply cannot understand how anyone can think Tal bagels is even good and better than Ess. 

Tal is, on their best of best days day, a 4/10 bagel. | Yeah tbh none of the other ones that get recommended in here ever measure up to Tal | Way too doughy ! Makes my stomachs hurt | LETTUCE ON LOX, TRAVESTY | I still think it absolutely sucks ! | Zabars? I like their food, but the bagel itself is so unremarkable. | Zabars preslices their bagels… | You sound very young. | Zucker are sucker's. Expensive for not great bagels. | Put in a to go order online and time it so it’s ready when you get there.  Best way to avoid the line. | Sandwich is fine yeah but the bagels themselves I love. I usually just grab a bag and eat at home. They're so big pillowy and fluffy, cake-y almost | LMAO ok buddy | Great advice! 🥯 | You didn’t really say anything about Tal here but yeah no idea how you can say Tal is better than ess 

Unless one of the locations is just leagues better than any of the Tal’s I’ve been to | Idk man. I’ve been to the Ess in midtown and it’s really not good. They cook their breakfast sandwiches in the microwave and the bagel was bland. I had the Tal on the UES and really liked their everything bagel. Personal preference | I prefer the 18th & 1st location for ess but I’ve been to midtown multiple times as well. I’ve also been to two Tal’s on the UES and they just were really average in my experience. I still disagree on which is better but in the end it is just about personal preference."

Where can I find Colombia Streetfood?,"Hello! Is there anywhere in the city where I can find Colombian streetfood? Like a desgranado, salchipapa and stuff like that. I moved here from Colombia and haven’t had any luck yet. Thank you","A few places I googled, no clue if they're any good.

[Latino Bites](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NLWbuzuY71XgSgNX6) is a Columbian x Mexican fusion restaurant in Jackson Heights. They have both Desgranado and Salchipapa

[Los Perros De Chucho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZUkLTpNPbcd3bq9M6) in Long Island City also have both on the menu.

Where do you go for soba now that ISE is closed? Manhattan preferred but open to traveling ,,"Soba noodle azuma
Uzuki | Cocoron | Still not over the fact that Ise is gone 😭 | Usually Cocoron. Mostly because of the extensive menu and fair prices.

There's a lot of good spots, but a lot of them are super pricey. I understand the level of effort, labor, and care that goes into making proper soba and I'm glad we have a wealth of options, but at a certain point I want to eat a plate of noodles without having to pay an exorbitant amount of money to consider the intricacies lol

Especially when I can whip up a pretty crushable zaru soba plate at home for like a fifth of the price and like triple the portion size that'll satisfy the urge. | Soba ya scratches the itch but def azuma | I didn't know Ise was gone! This is upsetting | I haven't enjoyed soba since Soba Koh closed.

Is Soba Totto still a thing? | Try Nippon (where I went when I was near midtown — ages ago). I’m assuming it’s still fabulous.  The beef soba salad is on my all time favorite nyc dish list. | place has a roach infestation. | Went three days before their closing. The chef just wanted to retire to return to Japan | It’s not very good imo | Yikes. I wonder if that’s partially why I ended up with food poisoning the last time I went. | Then don't go | why the fuck would I, I just said there were cockroaches there"

- Ping's Seafood | Adding a dark horse: Ceviche at Mariscos El Submarino | I'm amazed that Le Bernardin hasn't been mentioned yet. | I love the fluke and different types of crudo and cured fish at fox face | Shout out to Osakana in East Village | Le Bernardin obviously. 


But also Foxface Natural, they almost always have the whole fluke and a great variety of seafood dishes. | Barney Greengrass. 

Abuqir & Astoria Seafood | Toro ssambap from jeju noodlebar. Mmmmm fatty tuna | Theodora has a good mix of raw dry aged crudo and wood fire grilled fish dishes. | Pla Tod at Chalong in Hell’s Kitchen | The fish soup at Che Li- spicy, sour, and delicious. | I swear by the Grilled Branzino of Avra. | The sole francese at Joe's Restaurant in Ridgewood.

BCD tofu house - yellow croaker | The Halibut at Le CouCou | Thank you! | Do you know how to find a copycat recipe for this fish? | I second AbuQir!! | Thank you! | Haven’t had the ceviche but their aguachiles is the best I’ve add | I mean that's the obvious answer but might be a little pricey for some | Theodora is the answer | [removed] | I love fish francese and have been wanting to come here, thanks for the rec! | I went to Bondst today and tbh it was so underwhelming considering the price point. Maybe it’s the HY location, but at this price point I expect so much more from the food. | Second this… the fish at fish cheeks is phenomenal | This is from the OG Korean cooking lady, Maangchi

[https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gulbi-gui](https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gulbi-gui) | It can be. I do think the 130$ lunch prefix is a good deal for the quality of the food. | Go during lunch and sit in the bar area. [It’s cheaper.](https://www.le-bernardin.com/menus/dining-room/lunch) | Shit I better go patronize them immediately then | NO POLITICS | Ooh I didn't know that 👀 | no problemo, interested in what you think about it | I’ve only been to the noho location, never hy | Thanks! | That does look like a good deal. I guess I thought it was dinner only and everyone got the $350 tasting menu but maybe they have added hours back since the pandemic. | Dinner has options too. Tasting is $325, prix fix is $210. Still very reasonable compared to other tastings and the food is exquisite."
Best brunch / lunch - by Metropolitan Pavilion (18th & 6th),On Friday my wife and I are taking the day off to go to an event that starts in the early afternoon at the Metropolitan Pavilion. What’s the best spot near there for lunch / brunch? It’s rare we do something like this so don’t mind budget.,"If you are open on budget, I'd go have lunch at Union Square Cafe (great weekday lunch prix fixe) or Via Carota and walk the 15 mins over to Metropolitan Pavilion after.  

Closer by - Loulou's, Momoya, Jack's Wife Freda, Westville, Grey Dog.  All totally fine, just a little less of the ""we never do this; fun day off playing hooky"" vibes. | Thanks! I’m between USC YV and Loulous all look good! I’m guessing I won’t need a reservation at 1130 so I’ll see where we end up. Appreciate it."
Udon recs? ,"Hello all, I used to work in the kitchen at hanon and I loved the vibe there and would come by on my days off just to hang out because the food was amazing and not overly expensive and the vibe felt nice but still casual. Since they closed due to the fire I've yet to find somewhere to replace it (not for work just to visit lol) If anyone has any recs for another udon place that's actually fire but not too fancy please put me on. Preferably somewhere easily accessible via the l or m train but totally not required. ","Raku | Every now and then I still check if hanon magically reopened. I know it didn’t but I just gotta hold onto that little bit of hope. Anyways, I haven’t been able to find any place quite like it. I guess as others have recommended, Raku but to me it’s very different style than hanon. Still worth trying! | RIP hanon, I’m so sad it never came back | -	Raku

Tsurutontan used to give you a large udon (extra noodles) for the same price as the regular but they stopped doing that; around the same time, the quality seemed to have declined as well. | Raku (multiple locations), I think the Niku udon is their most popular but it's $25. It's soooo good well worth trying at least once.

They have cheaper udon for like $20 which is about the price of a decent ramen nowadays so I don't think it's unreasonable. | Raku is by far the best. Their noodle texture is insane. | I loved hanon :( I really think Udon st marks is great especially for the price. I HATE tsurutontan. | Muteki udon by Barclays is (I think) new and great | Any news about whether hanon will ever reopen? I love that so many people still message on their insta for updates on when they'll reopen! | Muteki Udon!! The chef of Uzuki Soba (Shuichi Kotani) in Greenpoint developed the menu with a couple of others. It’s fire. | I tried Tensai today and dont think I would recommend it. | Sobaya | I haven’t been but BBF is doing udon that looks really legit | Tsuru Ton Tan has a lot of tasty broth variations. Used to get them a lot for takeout during the pandemic. | Tsurutontan. Either midtown west or union sq locations | I miss Hanon


Was the owners artwork damaged at all by the fire? Was always so impressed with the art there | Shits so good | no place better than this. | the BEST | I've been meaning to try this place, it's been on my list for a while. Just curious about other options too | Well if you are ever in Chofu outside Tokyo, my old chef Hasegawa from hanon moved back there and opened a new spot that is very similar (go figure). The name is Udon Mugigaoca. | Hanon was the absolute best. I miss them so much and also check their instagram but it's still silent. I'll never forget the curry udon there. | Same. | I went to Tsurutontan last night for dinner and I’m sad to report it was literally disgusting (got two udon dishes, four rolls, some gyoza, and some curry. everything was bad; udon was terrible). | Definitely reasonable. I guess I'll have to go! | unfortunately not. they posted on their ig yesterday :( | Thank you! | In my personal opinion, Raku is the best. Tsurutontan for me, the broth always has a weird bitterness in the aftertaste. Not an udon spot, but I love the Inaniwa udon at Sakagura. They put, I believe, sudachi in it. | Raku is a must try. Best I’ve ever had | Raku is my favorite restaurant in the city. No other udon compares really. They have the chewiest, bounciest noodles and giant portions. Try the Kani Ankake or the Spicy Niku! The Chicken Tatsuta-age appetizer (like a fried chicken) is also insane. | Ooooo thank you so much for the intel! I’m headed back to Japan in December!! Will report back haha | ive came super close to recreating their curry udon you just need to make a good dashi (we used konbu and bonito) and they would cook the curry beef separately and add it at the end after assembling noodles + dashi which is why it wasn't so thick and curry block tasting. The only thing i haven't recreated is their chili oil which they made in house and i never got to learn the exact recipe but i would watch bro do it, im sure its fairly standard but it was also really good | Where are you working now then ? So the owner decided not to reopen? | Weirdly, the one time I went, I didn’t like the noodle texture. It was too mushy, like they were overcooked. I wonder if I got them on a bad day. I’d like to try again. 

The flavor of the broth was beautiful though.  | I haven't worked there since it initially closed, I kept in touch with the manager for a while but they ended up finding work elsewhere and the head chef moved back to japan so yeah it isn't looking very likely sadly. Eventually we all stopped meeting up and they never gave a firm answer | Kinda like little red hen bakery ;( | I don't want to say it's impossible but imagine a new concept is more likely. If i recall correctly (it's been a couple years and a couple jobs later) they had some relationship to that place called The Izakaya on 6th st. Last time I went they shared a couple of the same dishes (mentai udon and a couple apps) but im not sure what's up with them either. A good spot for sure but not udon lol"
