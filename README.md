# Python Database Manager

## Features

- Manage "Users", "Restaurants", "Playlists" and "Reviews" collections (modifiable) on a Google Firebase Firestore NoSQL database.
- Add new users, restaurants or restaurant playlists.
- View all existing data in the collections.
- Update current information on the database.
- User input for manual insertion of data.
- Batch addition of data with CSV file.

## Description of Our Data Model

Our data model will be designed with a NoSQL type database. Our Foodify program will revolve around three main entities, users, restaurants, reviews and playlists, with the username attribute being the primary key for entities, users, restaurants, and playlists. The first entity is Users including attributes: username, email, firstName, and lastName (all of type string), playlists being an array of references to playlist objects where each playlist is referenced by a unique identifier, and lastly the points map, which is broken down into generalPoints, postPoints, and reviewPoints(all type int).

The Restaurants entity includes 5 attributes of type maps. First being, contact which stores a collection of email, phone, and website of the restraunt. Next, dietaryOptions which stores 5 booleans of the restraunt specificities, that are: Kosher, halal, gluten free, vegan, or vegetarian. Also, the features entity is split into 6 additional booleans for other additional features that are also important, these are: Delivery, dinein, outdoor seating, parking , takeout, and wifi. Hours will give us the open and close timing of every day of the week in type string. Lastly, location of type map, stores the address divided into address, vity, country, postal code, state all of type string, and ofcourse the latitude and longitude of type geopoint. The restraunt entity is more complex, moreover the remaining attributes are mentioned in the firestore database you can hover over it to see its type, this paragraph just briefly describes some of its attributes. 

The Reviews entity includes attributes commentAuthor (type string), restaurantId (string), and review (string). The source attribute identifies where the review comes from, such as maps, reddit, or instagram. Lastly, the entity records a stars value (number), out of a score of 5.

Lasly, our last entity which is the playlists entity, which is designed to organize restaurant collections, similar to music playlists in a way. This entity has attributes like author  (type: string), which gives us the user who created the playlist, description  (type: string) that gives a brief overview of the playlist, and name  (type: string), which specifies the title of the playlist. The restaurants attribute is an array of references, with each element pointing to a specific restaurant entity from our restaurant entity. 

## Why we chose a NoSQL type database over SQL

Our entities contain numerous references to other entities, and a NoSQL database stores data as documents rather than in tables, making it easier to nest and access attributes. Since some attributes don't fit neatly into a fixed schema, we're working with unstructured data. For example, user reviews may vary in detailâ€”some may include comments and ratings, while others may only have a rating. A NoSQL database is ideal for handling such variable data without needing a rigid schema.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.0 or higher.
