I must confess, I am typically skeptical of experiences like this because some people have taken free meals just to say something nice and dishonest. But as a person who values integrity, I must confess this was not that case. Today at 3 PM, I and the same guest I visited with last time returned, and compared to last visit, our experiences were night and day when it came to the food. As previously shared, the atmosphere, service, and overall aesthetic of the restaurant were all phenomenal. This truly is a cozy establishment with genuine Italian influences that woo you. It is what draws you in initially and gives you high expectations and excitement for the meal you\u2019re about to have. I have no idea the fluctuating factors that could\u2019ve affected the meal the last time we were at Senza, but this time, the meal was delicious. Flavorful, fragrant, and delicious. Well seasoned, and cooked to perfection. I got the seafood spaghetti and my guest got the veal. Both dishes were something to rave about. Of course, the owner of the establishment tended to us well and shared her sincere heart of service and why she loves working where she does. And as a person with a great discernment for what\u2019s hidden behind people\u2019s words, I can tell you that she was being genuine. This isn\u2019t just another restaurant that wants to make money, but there is a genuine vision and dream behind this restaurant. A desire that, by hard work and faith, other people will be blessed by what comes out of this place. Because they were willing to seek reconciliation and to clarify the confusion that happened, they have earned longtime customers from me and my guest. It wasn\u2019t about giving us a delicious meal, but it was the open recognition of the review and a willingness to make it right. That is what made this experience phenomenal and the good food was an amazing plus. In the end, she even recommended that we come back and try the initial dishes we tried during the first visit. We definitely plan to with high hopes and restored excitement.\n\nThanks again.\nForgive me for taking a while to post this review as I\u2019ve been delayed through recovery. I had high hopes for this Restaurant. When arriving. The atmosphere was amazing, and the service was impeccable. We were politely greeted and immediately sat. It looks like a cute mom and pop small Italian restaurant. The waiter even offered complementary gluten-free bread for me. But, the most disappointing factor of this experience was the meal itself. While upon presentation, it looked incredible, the taste was disappointing. Beyond the lack of seasoning, there was no garlic to be experienced. With every bite, I desperately searched for satisfaction with mouth fools of basil. To say the lease, I was disappointed. The pasta is not made in house, but seems to be ordered from an outside source. They provided a great portion for the chicken Parmesan, but even then it lacked flavor. The only remnants of pleasure were found in the burnt sprinkles of cheese on the bread of the chicken. I don\u2019t even believe the chicken was marinated. I really had high hopes for this restaurant, considering myself, and my friend are both gluten-free. And it was a splurge. But spending between one $50-$200 for a plate of food that was not seasoned at all really was a low point of my day. And to top it all off, I had a severe stomach ache after. I\u2019m not sure what type of gluten-free bread they used, but they might need to reconsider what recipes they are using, or what they\u2019ve added. I hope this review helps someone consider this restaurant before their visit.\n\nPS, our table was next to a middle-aged Italian, a couple.

I take Subway food around 3 or 4 times and she was saying that she cannot cut it. There is no way, this is the new method now. We don't cut vegetables now. So first of all, if they don't wanna work fire, these kind of employees?  I also have a Subway franchises, I would never tolerate this kind of things and behavior. In my opinion this was horrible plus, when I was eating over there, the guy was sweeping all over the floor I asked him to do it after i m done eating my food? He was kept on sweeping the floor and you won't believe it.  I was getting the dirt in my mouth. And I can feel that crunchy flavor in my food because the whole dirt was getting into my food. If you don't believe it pull out the camera roll at that moment of time I literally left the store throwing my food in garbage.\n\nCheck the camera. This is the worst experience I've ever had.

Seriously,  it really shouldn\u2019t take you more than an hour to enjoy 12 pieces unless other circumstances occur.. The chef hands you a piece and tells you the piece and ingredients. After you finish the piece, he casually turns over and asks for your opinion (at least mine did). Each piece had such delicate and  flavorful combinations together. As I was almost close to my 12 piece, the lovely waitress comes over to ask if there might be any additional items I want to add and proceeds to show me some add on items. Of course, I want to add! I added another oyster with negitoro and uni because let me tell you, the first piece that the chef served was the oyster and the sweetness that came with that ocean flavor just opened up all of my food buds!

We got Vodka pizza since the server HIGHLY Recommended but honestly wasnt super special, somewhat disappointing.. we also got potato pizza. The server introduced as a new menu and the potato pizza would be what i would recommend.\n\nfor pasta, we got cacio e pepe and it was again good but nothing too special.. I think I saw their rainbow cookies are amazing on Instagram.. so of course we ordered that and it was good, but again nothing special\n\nThe service was friendly so I really wanted to write a good review. Well it was a good dining experience but i would not say that i'd come back or recommend to other people.

Here\u2019s why Sushi 295 Mercer stands out:\nQuality Fish: The owner focus is on top-notch fish. For just $23, you get a generous lunch meal of twelve sashimi, along with sushi rice on the side. The fish practically melts in your mouth, with exquisite flavors. I loved the sushi rice (not many places pay particular attention to it) \u2013 it was just the right texture, temperature, and the delicate taste \u2013 bravo!\nAuthentic Experience: The ambiance is cozy, not vested much in interior design \u2013 but in the food. It feels local, fits well into the neighborhood, and the friendly staff adds to the warm atmosphere.\nOmakase Option: If you feel adventurous, they also have 12 pieces sushi omakase.\nI went for Sushi & Sashimi dinner set of 6 nigiri and 9 sashimi accompanied by a toro roll (some extra). Still remember the taste of each piece, from yellowtail to salmon to scallop to tuna to toro. Exquisite!\nTrust me, it is worth exploring.
